However, existing works on drug recommendation either do not take the critical impact of doses on treatment outcomes into account, or neglect the patient’s personalized history and drug-drug interactions, resulting in suboptimal recommendation results. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel Temporal Prescription Generation (TPG) model in this paper. Specifically, we first utilize a message passing neural network to capture the interaction between drugs, combined with a decomposed long and short-term memory (LSTM-DE) to characterize patient’s general information. Then, we design a prescription generator based on recurrent neural network to generate drugs and estimate doses simultaneously.

To address the above problems, we propose a research method for drug recommendation based on feature interaction and graph convolution. First, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG) of drugs and perform feature extraction by graph convolution algorithm, which effectively captures the correlation between the neighbourhoods of medicines. Second, we enrich the vector representation of users and drugs by obtaining node information of users and drugs through a heterogeneous propagation layer and employing a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to distinguish the contributions of tail entities in different triples. In addition, we use a two-mechanism approach to dynamically learn the vector representations of users, which improves the recommendation effect of the model. Finally, the user feature vectors and drug feature vectors are fed into the prediction module to obtain the interaction probability between the user and the drug. Compared with other state-of-the-art mainstream models, the accuracy of the proposed model on drugs dataset and Book-Crossing dataset is improved by 1.01% and 0.8%, respectively.

Providing such a recommendation requires considering the implicit interaction within input user features as well as output candidates. In this paper, we propose a two-stage knowledge graph attention aggregation mechanism that helps recommend drug combinations for a patient based on his conditions. First, a disease-drug interaction graph is constructed and integrated with the medical domain knowledge, forming a collaborative knowledge graph. Secondly, an intra-feature attention aggregation is performed to obtain the representations of diseases and drugs based on drug-drug and disease-disease interactions, respectively. Thirdly, an inter-feature attention aggregation is performed using the disease-drug interaction to better represent a user's condition. Finally, the user's condition representation is concatenated with other user features to generate the final user representation for the prescription recommendation.

Patients' Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) determine how patients' drug combinations change along with the evolution of disease treatment. DTRs are effective for comprehending disease-treatment dynamics and for recommending a timely and personalized combination of medications for patients. However, existing medication recommender systems (MRSs) overlook the multiple treatment pathways generated by the intervention of DTRs and can only recommend a single treatment paradigm, ignoring the fact that patients may be at different treatment stages and thus require different treatment regime. Such disregard leads to a significant limitation in recommending personalized medication combinations tailored to different treatment stages, yielding greatly compromised accuracy and applicability of MRSs. Moreover, existing methods often overlook the time interval information over patients' successive visits, which is critical to indicate patients' treatment evolution. To address these significant gaps, we propose a Time-aware Medication Recommendation Framework via Intervention of Dynamic Treatment Regimes, called MR-DTR. To explicitly illustrate the intervention processes of DTRs on similar patients, we employ a co-guided graph to connect various patient sequences. In addition, to fully utilize the time interval information, we design a time-aware guidance mechanism dedicated to the co-guided graph to efficiently learn medication representation using the patient's guidance information. We also introduce relative time intervals in the encoder to act as positional information.

To address these limitations, we propose the TOpological Knowledge Enhanced PErsonalized Ranking (TOKEPER) model for sequential recommendation. TOKEPER first constructs a key-value Memory Neural Network based on historical clinical records of patients, and employs multi-hop reading to infer patient preferences for medication diversity, generating personalized probabilistic potentials for medications. Then TOKEPER calculates the topological potentials of medications based on concurrent prescription across patient cohort, translating global associations of medications into ranking criteria without relying on target sequences. By integrating these heterogeneous potentials, TOKEPER constructs supervised sequences for sequential medication recommendation.

Thus, they fail to capture the intensity of the patient’s condition, which leads to low accuracy on their recommendations. In this study, we propose a medication recommendation system that leverages the diagnosis intensity in medication recommendation (LDIM-R). The main goal of our model is to compare the severity of diagnoses at each visit to all the previous visits. The proposed study commences by accessing the patient’s historical health record from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). Subsequently, the average intensity of previous diagnoses is calculated and compared to the diagnosed intensity of the current visit. Then the proposed model considers three factors: 1) there is no discernible change in the overall diagnosed intensity; 2) the overall diagnosed intensity has declined; or 3) the overall diagnosed intensity has increased.

Since patients often suffer from multiple diseases and the disease status is dynamic, the model must take drug interactions into account when recommending drugs. However, most existing drug recommendation works only rely on patient electronic health records for medical predictions, current methods do not fully exploit the patient information and their interrelationships when constructing patient narratives, resulting in insufficient completeness of patient narratives. They also overlook the future trend of patient's condition changes, resulting in a high rate of DDI in recommended drug combinations. To work around these limitations, this paper proposes a drug recommendation model that combines attention mechanism and graph encoder.

Among all challenges, drug–drug interactions (DDI) related to undesired duplication, antagonism, or alternation between drugs could lead to fatal side effects. Previous researches usually provide models with DDI knowledge to achieve DDI reduction. However, the mixed use of patients with different DDI rates places stringent requirements on the generalization performance of models. In pursuit of a more effective method, we propose the adversarially regularized model for medication recommendation (ARMR). Specifically, ARMR firstly models temporal information from medical records to obtain patient representations and builds a key-value memory network based on information from historical admissions. Then, ARMR carries out multi-hop reading on the memory network to recommend medications. Meanwhile, ARMR uses a GAN model to adversarially regulate the distribution of patient representations by matching the distribution to a desired Gaussian distribution to achieve DDI reduction. Comparative evaluations between ARMR and baselines show that ARMR outperforms all baselines in terms of medication recommendation, achieving DDI reduction regardless of numbers of DDI types being considered.', 'doi': '10.1007/s10115-020-01513-9', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-020-01513-9', 'issn': '0219-1377', 'number': '1', 'volume': '63', 'address': 'Berlin, Heidelberg', 'publisher': 'Springer-Verlag', 'issue_date': 'Jan 2021', 'year': '2021', 'title': 'Adversarially regularized medication recommendation model with multi-hop memory network', 'author': 'Wang, Yanda and Chen, Weitong and Pi, Dechang and Yue, Lin', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'article', 'ID': '10.1007/s10115-020-01513-9'}"

In this paper, we integrate Electronic Health Record graph data incorporating patient, disease, therapy and drug information with either a synergistic or an adverse DDI knowledge graph to recommend safe and explainable medications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to compare three different medical data integration strategies based on the analysis stage (i.e. early, intermediate and late) at which integration takes place. By identifying those drugs that either complement each other or behave adversely, we are able to improve the efficacy of the patient’s therapy and/or minimize the toxicity and side effects. Moreover, we develop models to support doctors in comprehensively screening candidate drugs and their possible substitutes by providing also robust explanations alongside with the recommended medicine. We run experiments with three real-life medical data sets.
