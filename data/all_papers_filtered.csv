Contrastive Learning on Medical Intents for Sequential Prescription Recommendation,"Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Arya and Nayebi Kerdabadi, Mohsen and Liu, Mei and Yao, Zijun",2024.0,ACM,"{'series': ""CIKM '24"", 'location': 'Boise, ID, USA', 'keywords': 'contrastive learning, electronic health records, prescription recommendation', 'numpages': '10', 'pages': '748–757', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management', 'abstract': 'Recent advancements in sequential modeling applied to Electronic Health Records (EHR) have greatly influenced prescription recommender systems. While the recent literature on drug recommendation has shown promising performance, the study of discovering a diversity of coexisting temporal relationships at the level of medical codes over consecutive visits remains less explored. The goal of this study can be motivated from two perspectives. First, there is a need to develop a sophisticated sequential model capable of disentangling the complex relationships across sequential visits. Second, it is crucial to establish multiple and diverse health profiles for the same patient to ensure a comprehensive consideration of different medical intents in drug recommendation. To achieve this goal, we introduce Attentive Recommendation with Contrasted Intents (ARCI), a multi-level transformer-based method designed to capture the different but coexisting temporal paths across a shared sequence of visits. Specifically, we propose a novel intent-aware method with contrastive learning, that links specialized medical intents of the patients to the transformer heads for extracting distinct temporal paths associated with different health profiles. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets for the prescription recommendation task using both ranking and classification metrics. Our results demonstrate that ARCI has outperformed the state-of-the-art prescription recommendation methods and is capable of providing interpretable insights for healthcare practitioners.', 'doi': '10.1145/3627673.3679836', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3627673.3679836', 'address': 'New York, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Association for Computing Machinery', 'isbn': '9798400704369', 'year': '2024', 'title': 'Contrastive Learning on Medical Intents for Sequential Prescription Recommendation', 'author': 'Hadizadeh Moghaddam, Arya and Nayebi Kerdabadi, Mohsen and Liu, Mei and Yao, Zijun', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1145/3627673.3679836'}"

Patients' Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) determine how patients' drug combinations change along with the evolution of disease treatment. DTRs are effective for comprehending disease-treatment dynamics and for recommending a timely and personalized combination of medications for patients. However, existing medication recommender systems (MRSs) overlook the multiple treatment pathways generated by the intervention of DTRs and can only recommend a single treatment paradigm, ignoring the fact that patients may be at different treatment stages and thus require different treatment regime. Such disregard leads to a significant limitation in recommending personalized medication combinations tailored to different treatment stages, yielding greatly compromised accuracy and applicability of MRSs. Moreover, existing methods often overlook the time interval information over patients' successive visits, which is critical to indicate patients' treatment evolution. To address these significant gaps, we propose a Time-aware Medication Recommendation Framework via Intervention of Dynamic Treatment Regimes, called MR-DTR. To explicitly illustrate the intervention processes of DTRs on similar patients, we employ a co-guided graph to connect various patient sequences. In addition, to fully utilize the time interval information, we design a time-aware guidance mechanism dedicated to the co-guided graph to efficiently learn medication representation using the patient's guidance information. We also introduce relative time intervals in the encoder to act as positional information.

This paper seeks to utilize a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to represent EHR and develop a graph representation learning method for medication recommendation. However, three critical issues need to be investigated: (1) co-occurrence of diagnosis and drug for the same patient does not imply their relevance; (2) patients’ directly associated information may not be sufficient to reflect their health conditions; and (3) the cold start problem exists when patients have no historical EHRs. To tackle these challenges, we develop a bi-channel heterogeneous local structural encoder to decouple and extract the diverse information in HIN. Additionally, a global information capture and fusion module, aggregating meta-paths to form a global representation, is introduced to fill the information gaps in records.

Inf. Syst.', 'abstract': 'Medication recommendation is one of the most critical health-related applications, which has attracted extensive research interest recently. Most existing works focus on a single hospital with abundant medical data. However, many small hospitals only have a few records, which hinders applying existing medication recommendation works to the real world. Thus, we seek to explore a more practical setting, i.e., multi-center medication recommendation. In this setting, most hospitals have few records, but the total number of records is large. Though small hospitals may benefit from total affluent records, it is also faced with the challenge that the data distributions between various hospitals are much different. In this work, we introduce a novel Contrastive Pretrain Model with Prompt Tuning (TEMPT) for multi-center medication recommendation, which includes two stages of pretraining and finetuning. We first design two self-supervised tasks for the pretraining stage to learn general medical knowledge. They are mask prediction and contrastive tasks, which extract the intra- and inter-relationships of input diagnosis and procedures. Furthermore, we devise a novel prompt tuning method to capture the specific information of each hospital rather than adopting the common finetuning. On the one hand, the proposed prompt tuning can better learn the heterogeneity of each hospital to fit various distributions. On the other hand, it can also relieve the catastrophic forgetting problem of finetuning. To validate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on the public eICU, a multi-center medical dataset. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model.

To address these limitations, we propose the TOpological Knowledge Enhanced PErsonalized Ranking (TOKEPER) model for sequential recommendation. TOKEPER first constructs a key-value Memory Neural Network based on historical clinical records of patients, and employs multi-hop reading to infer patient preferences for medication diversity, generating personalized probabilistic potentials for medications.

First, they neglect the inherent characteristics of multiple views existing in patients' clinical data (e.g., diagnoses and procedures), leading to fragmented and inconsistent patient representations. Second, they do not fully exploit drug label information. Most models do not explicitly establish a mapping relationship between drug labels and patients' historical visits. To address these two problems, we proposed a label-aware multi-view drug recommendation model named LAMRec. In particular, LAMRec uses a cross-attention module to fuse information from the diagnosis and procedure views, and increases the mutual information of patient multi-view representations through multi-view contrastive loss; the label-wise attention mechanism fully explores drug label information by constructing an adaptive mapping of drug-visit to generate personalized representations that are aware of the drug-related visit information.

Existing learning-based approaches further consider the chemical structures of medications, but ignore the textual medication descriptions in which the functionalities are clearly described. Furthermore, the textual knowledge derived from the EHRs of patients remains largely underutilized. To address these issues, we introduce the Natural Language-Assisted Multi-modal Medication Recommendation (NLA-MMR), a multimodal alignment framework designed to learn knowledge from the patient view and medication view jointly. Specifically, NLA-MMR formulates CMR as an alignment problem from patient and medication modalities. In this vein, we employ pretrained language models (PLMs) to extract in-domain knowledge regarding patients and medications, serving as the foundational representation for both modalities. In the medication modality, we exploit both chemical structures and textual descriptions to create medication representations. In the patient modality, we generate the patient representations based on textual descriptions of diagnosis, procedure, and symptom.

Currently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for complicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it’s difficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors. This urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help treat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions. Due to the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research interests. Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a multi-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper, we propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel copy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient, the proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and medication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses. Then in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a medicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one.

Inf. Syst.', 'abstract': 'For care of chronic diseases (e.g., depression, diabetes, hypertension), it is critical to identify effective treatment pathways that aim to promptly update the medication following the change of patient state and disease progression. This task is challenging because the optimal treatment pathway for each patient needs to be personalized due to the significant heterogeneity among individuals. Therefore, it is naturally promising to investigate how to use the abundant electronic health records to recommend effective and safe prescriptions. However, prescription recommendation needs to consider multiple aspects of life-critical evidence, such as the information relevance in terms of medical concepts, the health condition in terms of diagnosis history, and the further constraint in terms of side information (e.g., patient demographics and drug side effects). To this end, in this article, we propose a novel prescription recommendation framework named OntoPath to predict the next drug in disease treatment pathways, by building an ontology-aware hierarchical-attention model that integrates multiple medical evidence from domain knowledge guidance, medical history profiling, and side information utilization. Specifically, our method can be characterized from three aspects: (1) by incorporating the longitudinal diagnosis history, we enrich the profiling of patients in terms of comprehensive health conditions, which can largely influence a drug’s outcome on individual patients; (2) using the hierarchical disease and drug ontology structures, we are able to model the domain-specific relevance between patients and drugs at multiple levels of granularity and achieve in-depth collaborative filtering; (3) we introduce a pre-training stage to enhance the discriminativeness of network representations, which helps us obtain a premium model initialization to further boost the final recommendation training. We perform extensive experiments on a large-scale depression cohort with over 37,000 patients from a real-world medical claims database.

However, the mixed use of patients with different DDI rates places stringent requirements on the generalization performance of models.

Then, ARMR carries out multi-hop reading on the memory network to recommend medications. Meanwhile, ARMR uses a GAN model to adversarially regulate the distribution of patient representations by matching the distribution to a desired Gaussian distribution to achieve DDI reduction.

To address these limitations, we propose CausalMed, a patient health state-centric model capable of enhancing the personalization of patient representations. Specifically, CausalMed first captures the causal relationship between diseases/procedures and medications through causal discovery and evaluates their causal effects. Building upon this, CausalMed focuses on analyzing the health state of patients, capturing the dynamic differences of diseases/procedures in different health states of patients, and transforming diseases/procedures into medications on direct causal relationships.

FFBDNet also has a greedy loss function to improve accuracy and DDI rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FFBDNet by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset. FFBDNet outperformed all baselines in all effective measures, reduced relatively the DDI rate by 97.65% from existing EHR data, and also is shown to improve 1.02% on Jaccard similarity.', 'doi': '10.1007/978-3-031-26422-1_26', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-26422-1_26', 'address': 'Berlin, Heidelberg', 'publisher': 'Springer-Verlag', 'isbn': '978-3-031-26421-4', 'year': '2022', 'title': 'FFBDNet: Feature Fusion and Bipartite Decision Networks for Recommending Medication Combination', 'author': 'Wang, Zisen and Liang, Ying and Liu, Zhengjun', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1007/978-3-031-26422-1_26'}"

In CADRE, we first cluster the drugs into several groups according to the functional description information, and design a basic personalized drug recommendation based on user collaborative filtering. Then, considering the shortcomings of collaborative filtering algorithm, such as computing expensive, cold start, and data sparsity, we propose a cloud-assisted approach for enriching end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) of drug recommendation, by modeling and representing the relationship of the user, symptom and medicine via tensor decomposition.

However, the method remains less explored in asynchronous multi-view sequential learning, and the unalignment nature of multiple sequences poses a great challenge to learn the inter-view interactions. We develop an AMANet (Attention and Memory-Augmented Networks) architecture by integrating both attention and memory to solve asynchronous multi-view learning problem in general, and we focus on experiments in dual-view sequences in this paper. Self-attention and inter-attention are employed to capture intra-view interaction and inter-view interaction, respectively. History attention memory is designed to store the historical information of a specific object, which serves as local knowledge storage. Dynamic external memory is used to store global knowledge for each view. We evaluate our model in three tasks: medication recommendation from a patient's medical records, diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification from a hospital record, and invoice fraud detection through a company's taxation behaviors. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms all baselines and other state-of-the-art models in all tasks.

These patients often follow a treatment consisting of multiple drugs simultaneously. Previous research works have already made predictions of next drug combinations based on the integration of the patients’ health records with an adverse drug–drug interaction (DDI) knowledge graph in order to minimize drug side effects. However, they missed to consider additional valuable information coming from synergistic drug–drug interaction knowledge graphs. In this paper, we integrate Electronic Health Record graph data incorporating patient, disease, therapy and drug information with either a synergistic or an adverse DDI knowledge graph to recommend safe and explainable medications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to compare three different medical data integration strategies based on the analysis stage (i.e. early, intermediate and late) at which integration takes place. By identifying those drugs that either complement each other or behave adversely, we are able to improve the efficacy of the patient’s therapy and/or minimize the toxicity and side effects. Moreover, we develop models to support doctors in comprehensively screening candidate drugs and their possible substitutes by providing also robust explanations alongside with the recommended medicine. We run experiments with three real-life medical data sets. In terms of suggesting safe and effective drugs, our proposed method suggests 34 times more synergistic drugs than the baseline algorithm for the cancer data set and reduces the unwanted side effects to patients’ medication by 2350 times more than the baseline algorithm for the MIMIC III data set.

Order-free Medicine Combination Prediction with Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning,"Wang, Shanshan and Ren, Pengjie and Chen, Zhumin and Ren, Zhaochun and Ma, Jun and de Rijke, Maarten",2019.0,ACM,"{'series': ""CIKM '19"", 'location': 'Beijing, China', 'keywords': 'medicine combination prediction, medicine knowledge graph, reinforcement learning, relational graph convolutional network', 'numpages': '10', 'pages': '1623–1632', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management', 'abstract': 'Medicine Combination Prediction (MCP) based on Electronic Health Record (EHR) can assist doctors to prescribe medicines for complex patients. Previous studies on MCP either ignore the correlations between medicines (i.e., MCP is formulated as a binary classifcation task), or assume that there is a sequential correlation between medicines (i.e., MCP is formulated as a sequence prediction task). The latter is unreasonable because the correlations between medicines should be considered in an order-free way. Importantly, MCP must take additional medical knowledge (e.g., Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI)) into consideration to ensure the safety of medicine combinations. However, most previous methods for MCP incorporate DDI knowledge with a post-processing scheme, which might undermine the integrity of proposed medicine combinations. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional reinforcement learning model for MCP, named Combined Order-free Medicine Prediction Network (CompNet), that addresses the issues listed above. CompNet casts the MCP task as an order-free Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and designs a Deep Q Learning (DQL) mechanism to learn correlative and adverse interactions between medicines. Specifcally, we frst use a Dual Convolutional Neural Network (Dual-CNN) to obtain patient representations based on EHRs. Then, we introduce the medicine knowledge associated with predicted medicines to create a dynamic medicine knowledge graph, and use a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to encode it. Finally, CompNet selects medicines by fusing the combination of patient information and the medicine knowledge graph. Experiments on a benchmark dataset, i.e., MIMIC-III, demonstrate that CompNet signifcantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves a recently proposed model by 3.74%pt, 6.64%pt in terms of Jaccard and F1 metrics.', 'doi': '10.1145/3357384.3357965', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3357384.3357965', 'address': 'New York, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Association for Computing Machinery', 'isbn': '9781450369763', 'year': '2019', 'title': 'Order-free Medicine Combination Prediction with Graph Convolutional Reinforcement Learning', 'author': 'Wang, Shanshan and Ren, Pengjie and Chen, Zhumin and Ren, Zhaochun and Ma, Jun and de Rijke, Maarten', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1145/3357384.3357965'}"

Most existing works predicted medications based on longitudinal records, which assumed the encoding format of intra-visit medical events are serialized and information transmitted patterns of learning longitudinal sequence data are stable. However, the following conditions may have been ignored: 1) A more compact encoder for intra-relationship in the intra-visit medical event is urgent; 2) Strategies for learning accurate representations of the variable longitudinal sequences of patients are different. In this article, we proposed a novel Sample-adaptive Hierarchical medicAtion Prediction nEtwork, termed SHAPE, to tackle the above challenges in the medication recommendation task. Specifically, we design a compact intra-visit set encoder to encode the relationship in the medical event for obtaining visit-level representation and then develop an inter-visit longitudinal encoder to learn the patient-level longitudinal representation efficiently. To endow the model with the capability of modeling the variable visit length, we introduce a soft curriculum learning method to assign the difficulty of each sample automatically by the visit length.

The field of prescription recommendation has attracted a growing body of research interest, given its significant clinical value. However, existing research has not taken into account the patients’ intention to visit the doctor and the similarities between patients’ visit intentions. In this study, we employ medical order data in both prescription intention modeling and patient similarity analysis, subsequently integrating these to generate more personalized and accurate prescription recommendations. The cross-attention mechanism is first employed to focus the representation of the patient’s health status on the patient’s chief complaints, with the objective of predicting treatment intention and, subsequently, the prescriptions. Subsequently, when we learn from the successful treatment experiences of similar patients, we focus more on the similarities of their chief complaints. The experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method achieves optimal performance in terms of Jaccard score, PRAUC, F1 score and average precision, with relative improvements of 7%, 5%, 4%, and 8% respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.', 'ISSN': '2169-3536', 'ISBNs': nan, 'DOI': '10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3459080', 'Funding Information': 'Regional Comprehensive Application Demonstration of Digital Intelligence Technology for Active Health Services(grant numbers:2023YFC3605800); Construction and Application of Early Diagnosis and Prediction Model for Gestational Diabetes Based on Multimodal Information(grant numbers:BE2023781); Key Research and Development Program of Wuhan(grant numbers:2022012202015070); “Selective Candidate” Joint Research Fund of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development District(grant numbers:2022KJB126); ', 'PDF Link': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10679140', 'Author Keywords': 'Prescription recommendation;electronic health record;patient similarity analysis;attention mechanism', 'IEEE Terms': 'Medical diagnostic imaging;Drugs;Diseases;Electronic medical records;Codes;Hospitals;Attention mechanisms', 'Mesh_Terms': nan, 'Article Citation Count': nan, 'Patent Citation Count': nan, 'Reference Count': 31, 'License': 'CCBY', 'Online Date': '12 Sep 2024', 'Issue Date': nan, 'Meeting Date': nan, 'Publisher': 'IEEE', 'Document Identifier': 'IEEE Journals'}"

Most existing methods either only make recommendation through EHRs of the current admission while ignoring the patient's historical records, or fail to fully consider the correlations among the clinical events from every single admission. These methods have shown their limitations in dealing with the complex structural correlations and temporal dependencies of clinical events in EHRs, which results in the defect of recommendation quality as well as the lack of temporal prediction ability. For that, a novel graph-attention augmented temporal neural network is proposed to model both the structural and temporal information simultaneously. For each admission record, a co-occurrence graph is constructed to establish the correlations among clinical events, and then a graph-attention augmented mechanism is used to learn the structural correlations on the graphs to obtain better representation of this admission. Then a temporal updating module based on the gated recurrent units is further proposed to learn the temporal dependencies between multiple admissions of each patient. Furthermore, our proposed model is also constrained by the co-occurrence graph, which can capture the internal correlations of clinical events and provide better modeling capability when the training data is sparse.

Electronic Health Records are used to incorporate medical history into longitudinal models. This project proposes a novel Knowledge Graph-Driven Medicine Recommendation System using Graph Neural Networks, KGDNet, that utilises longitudinal EHR data along with ontologies and Drug-Drug Interaction knowledge to construct admission-wise clinical and medicine Knowledge Graphs for every patient. Recurrent Neural Networks are employed to model a patient’s historical data, and Graph Neural Networks are used to learn embeddings from the Knowledge Graphs. A Transformer-based Attention mechanism is then used to generate medication recommendations for the patient, considering their current clinical state, medication history, and joint medical records.
