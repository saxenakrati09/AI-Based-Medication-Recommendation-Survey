Leave No Patient Behind: Enhancing Medication Recommendation for Rare Disease Patients,"Zhao, Zihao and Jing, Yi and Feng, Fuli and Wu, Jiancan and Gao, Chongming and He, Xiangnan",2024.0,ACM,"{'series': ""SIGIR '24"", 'location': 'Washington DC, USA', 'keywords': 'electronic health record, fairness, medication recommendation, rare disease', 'numpages': '10', 'pages': '533–542', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval', 'abstract': ""Medication recommendation systems have gained significant attention in healthcare as a means of providing tailored and effective drug combinations based on patients' clinical information. However, existing approaches often suffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigm to enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoder with a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships among disease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervised pre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and Self Reconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelations among clinical codes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RAREMed provides accurate drug sets for both rare and common disease patients, thereby mitigating unfairness in medication recommendation systems.

REFINE: a fine-grained medication recommendation system using deep learning and personalized drug interaction modeling,"Bhoi, Suman and Lee, Mong Li and Hsu, Wynne and Tan, Ngiap Chuan",2023.0,ACM,"{'series': ""NIPS '23"", 'location': 'New Orleans, LA, USA', 'numpages': '12', 'articleno': '1043', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems', 'abstract': ""Patients with co-morbidities often require multiple medications to manage their conditions. However, existing medication recommendation systems only offer class-level medications and regard all interactions among drugs to have the same level of severity. This limits their ability to provide personalized and safe recommendations tailored to individual needs. In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based finegrained medication recommendation system called REFINE, which is designed to improve treatment outcomes and minimize adverse drug interactions. In order to better characterize patient's health conditions, we model the trend in medication dosage titrations and lab test responses, and adapt the vision transformer to obtain effective patient representations. We also model drug interaction severity levels as weighted graphs to learn safe drug combinations and design a balanced loss function to avoid overly conservative recommendations and miss medications that might be needed for certain conditions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets shows that REFINE outperforms state-of-the-art techniques."", 'address': 'Red Hook, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Curran Associates Inc.', 'year': '2023', 'title': 'REFINE: a fine-grained medication recommendation system using deep learning and personalized drug interaction modeling', 'author': 'Bhoi, Suman and Lee, Mong Li and Hsu, Wynne and Tan, Ngiap Chuan', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.5555/3666122.3667165'}"
Interaction-Aware Temporal Prescription Generation via&nbsp;Message Passing Neural Network,"Wang, Cong and Zheng, Zhi and Xu, Tong and Yin, Zikai and Chen, Enhong",2022.0,ACM,"{'location': 'Beijing, China', 'keywords': 'Drug recommendation, Graph neural network', 'numpages': '12', 'pages': '218–229', 'booktitle': 'Artificial Intelligence: Second CAAI International Conference, CICAI 2022, Beijing, China, August 27–28, 2022, Revised Selected Papers, Part II', 'abstract': 'In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied with great success in the healthcare industry, such as disease prediction and drug recommendation. However, existing works on drug recommendation either do not take the critical impact of doses on treatment outcomes into account, or neglect the patient’s personalized history and drug-drug interactions, resulting in suboptimal recommendation results. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel Temporal Prescription Generation (TPG) model in this paper. Specifically, we first utilize a message passing neural network to capture the interaction between drugs, combined with a decomposed long and short-term memory (LSTM-DE) to characterize patient’s general information. Then, we design a prescription generator based on recurrent neural network to generate drugs and estimate doses simultaneously. Experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the best existing models in terms of drug recommendation and dose estimation.', 'doi': '10.1007/978-3-031-20500-2_18', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20500-2_18', 'address': 'Berlin, Heidelberg', 'publisher': 'Springer-Verlag', 'isbn': '978-3-031-20499-9', 'year': '2022', 'title': 'Interaction-Aware Temporal Prescription Generation via&nbsp;Message Passing Neural Network', 'author': 'Wang, Cong and Zheng, Zhi and Xu, Tong and Yin, Zikai and Chen, Enhong', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1007/978-3-031-20500-2_18'}"
Research on Drug Recommendation Based on Feature Interaction and Graph Convolution,"Zhu, Jingyun and Yilahun, Hankiz and Hamdulla, Askar",2024.0,ACM,"{'series': ""ICAICE '23"", 'location': 'Dalian, China', 'keywords': 'Drug Recommendation, Feature Interaction, Graph Convolution, Heterogeneous Propagation, Knowledge Graph', 'numpages': '6', 'pages': '1214–1219', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Engineering', 'abstract': 'Existing drug recommendation algorithms often ignore the role played by neighbourhood information among drugs in recommendation, and it is difficult to model user features. To address the above problems, we propose a research method for drug recommendation based on feature interaction and graph convolution. First, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG) of drugs and perform feature extraction by graph convolution algorithm, which effectively captures the correlation between the neighbourhoods of medicines. Second, we enrich the vector representation of users and drugs by obtaining node information of users and drugs through a heterogeneous propagation layer and employing a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to distinguish the contributions of tail entities in different triples. In addition, we use a two-mechanism approach to dynamically learn the vector representations of users, which improves the recommendation effect of the model. Finally, the user feature vectors and drug feature vectors are fed into the prediction module to obtain the interaction probability between the user and the drug. Compared with other state-of-the-art mainstream models, the accuracy of the proposed model on drugs dataset and Book-Crossing dataset is improved by 1.01% and 0.8%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has high recommendation accuracy and superior overall performance.', 'doi': '10.1145/3652628.3652827', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3652628.3652827', 'address': 'New York, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Association for Computing Machinery', 'isbn': '9798400708831', 'year': '2024', 'title': 'Research on Drug Recommendation Based on Feature Interaction and Graph Convolution', 'author': 'Zhu, Jingyun and Yilahun, Hankiz and Hamdulla, Askar', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1145/3652628.3652827'}"
Context-aware safe medication recommendations with molecular graph and DDI graph embedding,"Chen, Qianyu and Li, Xin and Geng, Kunnan and Wang, Mingzhong",2023.0,ACM,"{'series': ""AAAI'23/IAAI'23/EAAI'23"", 'numpages': '8', 'articleno': '792', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the Thirty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Thirty-Fifth Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence and Thirteenth Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence', 'abstract': 'Molecular structures and Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) are recognized as important knowledge to guide medication recommendation (MR) tasks, and medical concept embedding has been applied to boost their performance. Though promising performance has been achieved by leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to encode the molecular structures of medications or/and DDI, we observe that existing models are still defective: 1) to differentiate medications with similar molecules but different functionality; or/and 2) to properly capture the unintended reactions between drugs in the embedding space. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Carmen, a cautiously designed graph embedding-based MR framework. Carmen consists of four components, including patient representation learning, context information extraction, context-aware GNN, and DDI encoding. Carmen incorporates the visit history into the representation learning of molecular graphs to distinguish molecules with similar topology but dissimilar activity. Its DDI encoding module is specially devised for the non-transitive interaction DDI graphs. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Carmen achieves remarkable performance improvement over state-of-the-art models and can improve the safety of recommended drugs with proper DDI graph encoding.', 'doi': '10.1609/aaai.v37i6.25861', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v37i6.25861', 'publisher': 'AAAI Press', 'isbn': '978-1-57735-880-0', 'year': '2023', 'title': 'Context-aware safe medication recommendations with molecular graph and DDI graph embedding', 'author': 'Chen, Qianyu and Li, Xin and Geng, Kunnan and Wang, Mingzhong', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1609/aaai.v37i6.25861'}"
MRIGAT: Many-to-many Recommendation using Interaction based Knowledge Graph Attention,"Gao, Feng and Yuan, Kai and Gu, Jinguang and Liu, Yun",2022.0,ACM,"{'series': ""ISAIMS '22"", 'location': 'Amsterdam, Netherlands', 'keywords': 'attention, graph neural network, knowledge graph, many-to-many recommendation', 'numpages': '7', 'pages': '247–253', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 3rd International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence for Medicine Sciences', 'abstract': ""Recommendation systems combining Graph Neural Networks and Knowledge Graphs have been successfully applied in various domains. However, most existing approaches only consider one-to-one or one-to-many user-item interactions and cannot cater to many-to-many recommendation scenarios, such as providing prescriptions based on clinical diagnosis and medical history. Providing such a recommendation requires considering the implicit interaction within input user features as well as output candidates. In this paper, we propose a two-stage knowledge graph attention aggregation mechanism that helps recommend drug combinations for a patient based on his conditions. First, a disease-drug interaction graph is constructed and integrated with the medical domain knowledge, forming a collaborative knowledge graph. Secondly, an intra-feature attention aggregation is performed to obtain the representations of diseases and drugs based on drug-drug and disease-disease interactions, respectively. Thirdly, an inter-feature attention aggregation is performed using the disease-drug interaction to better represent a user's condition. Finally, the user's condition representation is concatenated with other user features to generate the final user representation for the prescription recommendation. Experiments with realistic datasets show that our approach can outperform existing recommendation systems by 4.3% and 6.1% in precision and recall, respectively."", 'doi': '10.1145/3570773.3570888', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1145/3570773.3570888', 'address': 'New York, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Association for Computing Machinery', 'isbn': '9781450398442', 'year': '2022', 'title': 'MRIGAT: Many-to-many Recommendation using Interaction based Knowledge Graph Attention', 'author': 'Gao, Feng and Yuan, Kai and Gu, Jinguang and Liu, Yun', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1145/3570773.3570888'}"
