abstract = {Recent advancements in sequential modeling applied to Electronic Health Records (EHR) have greatly influenced prescription recommender systems. While the recent literature on drug recommendation has shown promising performance, the study of discovering a diversity of coexisting temporal relationships at the level of medical codes over consecutive visits remains less explored. The goal of this study can be motivated from two perspectives. First, there is a need to develop a sophisticated sequential model capable of disentangling the complex relationships across sequential visits. Second, it is crucial to establish multiple and diverse health profiles for the same patient to ensure a comprehensive consideration of different medical intents in drug recommendation. To achieve this goal, we introduce Attentive Recommendation with Contrasted Intents (ARCI), a multi-level transformer-based method designed to capture the different but coexisting temporal paths across a shared sequence of visits. Specifically, we propose a novel intent-aware method with contrastive learning, that links specialized medical intents of the patients to the transformer heads for extracting distinct temporal paths associated with different health profiles. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets for the prescription recommendation task using both ranking and classification metrics. Our results demonstrate that ARCI has outperformed the state-of-the-art prescription recommendation methods and is capable of providing interpretable insights for healthcare practitioners.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation aims to suggest personalized drug combinations to patients based on their longitudinal medical histories stored in electronic health record (EHR) datasets. Patients' Dynamic Treatment Regimes (DTRs) determine how patients' drug combinations change along with the evolution of disease treatment. DTRs are effective for comprehending disease-treatment dynamics and for recommending a timely and personalized combination of medications for patients. However, existing medication recommender systems (MRSs) overlook the multiple treatment pathways generated by the intervention of DTRs and can only recommend a single treatment paradigm, ignoring the fact that patients may be at different treatment stages and thus require different treatment regime. Such disregard leads to a significant limitation in recommending personalized medication combinations tailored to different treatment stages, yielding greatly compromised accuracy and applicability of MRSs. Moreover, existing methods often overlook the time interval information over patients' successive visits, which is critical to indicate patients' treatment evolution. To address these significant gaps, we propose a Time-aware Medication Recommendation Framework via Intervention of Dynamic Treatment Regimes, called MR-DTR. To explicitly illustrate the intervention processes of DTRs on similar patients, we employ a co-guided graph to connect various patient sequences. In addition, to fully utilize the time interval information, we design a time-aware guidance mechanism dedicated to the co-guided graph to efficiently learn medication representation using the patient's guidance information. We also introduce relative time intervals in the encoder to act as positional information. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that MR-DTR surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation performance.

abstract = {Personalized medication recommendation aims to recommend appropriate medications to patients and has high practical value. In the current drug recommendation research, some recommendation methods ignore patients' personal valid information resulting in inaccurate results, and some recommendation methods using medical knowledge graph as auxiliary information suffer from underutilization of the graph's valid information or bring noise. To alleviate these problems, a multi-task learning model MHKMR with multi-hop knowledge graph embedding to assist personalized medication recommendation is put forward in this paper. Specifically, in the recommendation task, the model utilizes the detailed personal information of the patient to obtain a rich representation of the patient's features; in the knowledge graph embedding task, the model fully explores more effective information in the knowledge graph by utilizing the multi-hop technique. Moreover, the model introduces the information complementarity module to realize the information complementarity between the items in the recommendation and the entities in the knowledge graph, so as to obtain richer drug feature representations. This paper conducts extensive experiments on two public and real datasets and compares them with some advanced baseline models, and the results of the experiments verify that MHKMR provides excellent recommendation performance.},

abstract = {Electronic health records (EHRs) contain vast medical information like diagnosis, medication, and procedures, enabling personalized drug recommendations and treatment adjustments. However, current drug recommendation methods only model patients’ health conditions from EHR data, neglecting the rich relationships within the data. This paper seeks to utilize a heterogeneous information network (HIN) to represent EHR and develop a graph representation learning method for medication recommendation. However, three critical issues need to be investigated: (1) co-occurrence of diagnosis and drug for the same patient does not imply their relevance; (2) patients’ directly associated information may not be sufficient to reflect their health conditions; and (3) the cold start problem exists when patients have no historical EHRs. To tackle these challenges, we develop a bi-channel heterogeneous local structural encoder to decouple and extract the diverse information in HIN. Additionally, a global information capture and fusion module, aggregating meta-paths to form a global representation, is introduced to fill the information gaps in records. A longitudinal model using rich structural information available in EHR data is proposed for drug recommendations to new patients. Experimental results on real-world EHR data demonstrate significant improvements over existing approaches.},

In this work, we proposed FastRx, a Fastformer-based medication recommendation model to capture longitudinality in patient history, in combination with Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to handle DDIs and co-prescribed medications in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Our extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrated superior performance of the proposed FastRx over existing state-of-the-art models for medication recommendation.

abstract = {Medication recommendation is one of the most critical health-related applications, which has attracted extensive research interest recently. Most existing works focus on a single hospital with abundant medical data. However, many small hospitals only have a few records, which hinders applying existing medication recommendation works to the real world. Thus, we seek to explore a more practical setting, i.e., multi-center medication recommendation. In this setting, most hospitals have few records, but the total number of records is large. Though small hospitals may benefit from total affluent records, it is also faced with the challenge that the data distributions between various hospitals are much different. In this work, we introduce a novel Contrastive Pretrain Model with Prompt Tuning (TEMPT) for multi-center medication recommendation, which includes two stages of pretraining and finetuning. We first design two self-supervised tasks for the pretraining stage to learn general medical knowledge. They are mask prediction and contrastive tasks, which extract the intra- and inter-relationships of input diagnosis and procedures. Furthermore, we devise a novel prompt tuning method to capture the specific information of each hospital rather than adopting the common finetuning. On the one hand, the proposed prompt tuning can better learn the heterogeneity of each hospital to fit various distributions. On the other hand, it can also relieve the catastrophic forgetting problem of finetuning. To validate the proposed model, we conduct extensive experiments on the public eICU, a multi-center medical dataset. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our model. The implementation code is available to ease the reproducibility.1},

abstract = {Sequential medication recommendation is a crucial healthcare application designed to administer medications in appropriate sequences. While clinical records offer extensive information on patient conditions, they often lack precise prescribing times needed for constructing target sequences. Previous studies have achieved advances in item ranking for recommendation, but fail to address personalized patient preference for medication diversity or translate global medication associations into ranking scores without target sequences. To address these limitations, we propose the TOpological Knowledge Enhanced PErsonalized Ranking (TOKEPER) model for sequential recommendation. TOKEPER first constructs a key-value Memory Neural Network based on historical clinical records of patients, and employs multi-hop reading to infer patient preferences for medication diversity, generating personalized probabilistic potentials for medications. Then TOKEPER calculates the topological potentials of medications based on concurrent prescription across patient cohort, translating global associations of medications into ranking criteria without relying on target sequences. By integrating these heterogeneous potentials, TOKEPER constructs supervised sequences for sequential medication recommendation. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that TOKEPER yields satisfactory outcomes and facilitate effective sequential medication recommendation.},

Advances in recommender technologies have the potential to utilize this information to help doctors personalize the prescribed medications. However, existing medication recommendation systems have yet to make use of all these information sources in a seamless manner, and they do not provide a justification on why a particular medication is recommended. In this work, we design a two-stage personalized medication recommender system called PREMIER that incorporates information from the EHR. We utilize the various weights in the system to compute the contributions from the information sources for the recommended medications. Our system models the drug interaction from an external drug database and the drug co-occurrence from the EHR as graphs. Experiment results on MIMIC-III and a proprietary outpatient dataset show that PREMIER outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation systems while achieving the best tradeoff between accuracy and drug-drug interaction. Case studies demonstrate that the justifications provided by PREMIER are appropriate and aligned to clinical practices.},

abstract = {In recent years, the patient’s medical records have grown rapidly. This has led to the need of medication recommendation systems that use past diagnoses and personalize the proposed treatment. The majority of those systems prioritize medication recommendations based on the current diagnoses of the patient’s electronic health record (EHR) without considering diagnosis intensity. Thus, they fail to capture the intensity of the patient’s condition, which leads to low accuracy on their recommendations. In this study, we propose a medication recommendation system that leverages the diagnosis intensity in medication recommendation (LDIM-R). The main goal of our model is to compare the severity of diagnoses at each visit to all the previous visits. The proposed study commences by accessing the patient’s historical health record from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). Subsequently, the average intensity of previous diagnoses is calculated and compared to the diagnosed intensity of the current visit. Then the proposed model considers three factors: 1) there is no discernible change in the overall diagnosed intensity; 2) the overall diagnosed intensity has declined; or 3) the overall diagnosed intensity has increased. As demonstrated by the result of our experiments over the MIMIC-III dataset, our method outperformed state-of-the-art medication recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Making accurate and safe clinical decisions for patients has long been a challenging task. With the proliferation of electronic health records and the rapid advancement of technology, drug recommender systems have emerged as invaluable aids for healthcare professionals, offering precise and secure prescriptions. Among prevailing methods, the exploration of motifs, defined as substructures with specific biological functions, has largely been overlooked. Nevertheless, the substantial impact of the motifs on drug efficacy and patient diseases implies that a more extensive incorporation could potentially improve the recommender systems. In light of this, we introduce &lt;italic&gt;DEPOT&lt;/italic&gt;, an innovative drug recommendation framework developed from a motif-aware perspective. In our approach, we employ chemical decomposition to partition drug molecules into semantic motif-trees and design a structure-aware graph transformer to capture motif collaboration. This innovative practice preserves the topology knowledge and facilitates perception of drug functionality. To delve into the dynamic correlation between motifs and disease progression, we conduct a meticulous investigation from two perspectives: repetition and exploration. This comprehensive analysis allows us to gain valuable insights into the drug turnover, with the former focusing on reusability and the latter on discovering new requirements. We further formulate a historical weighting strategy for drug-drug interaction (DDI) objective, enabling adaptive control over the trade-off between accuracy and safety criteria throughout the training process. Extensive experiments conducted on four data sets validate the effectiveness and robustness of &lt;italic&gt;DEPOT&lt;/italic&gt;.},

Existing medication recommendation models are built based on the temporal structured code data of electronic health records (EHRs) in the medical database; nevertheless, unstructured data in EHRs, such as textual data containing rich information, are underexploited. To fill the gap, a novel multimodal interactive fusion network (MIFNet) is proposed for medication recommendation, which integrates both structured code information and unstructured text information in EHRs. Our model first extracts a series of informative feature representations to encode comprehensive patient health history and control potential drug–drug interactions (DDI), including medical code, clinical notes, and the DDI knowledge graph. Next, a novel cross-modal interaction extraction block is proposed to capture the intricate interaction information between the two modalities. Finally, a multimodal fusion block is adopted to fuse the constructed features and generate a medication combination list. Experiments are conducted on the public MIMIC-III dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on main evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Drug recommendation is an important task of AI for healthcare. To recommend proper drugs, existing methods rely on various clinical records (e.g., diagnosis and procedures), which are commonly found in data such as electronic health records (EHRs). However, detailed records as such are often not available and the inputs might merely include a set of symptoms provided by doctors. Moreover, existing drug recommender systems usually treat drugs as individual items, ignoring the unique requirements that drug recommendation has to be done on a set of items (drugs), which should be as small as possible and safe without harmful drug-drug interactions (DDIs).To deal with the challenges above, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of Symptom-based Set-to-set Small and Safe drug recommendation (4SDrug). To enable set-to-set comparison, we design set-oriented representation and similarity measurement for both symptoms and drugs. Further, towards the symptom sets, we devise importance-based set aggregation to enhance the accuracy of symptom set representation; towards the drug sets, we devise intersection-based set augmentation to ensure smaller drug sets, and apply knowledge-based and data-driven penalties to ensure safer drug sets. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets, i.e., the public benchmark one of MIMIC-III and the industrial large-scale one of NELL, show drastic performance gains brought by 4SDrug, which outperforms all baselines in most effectiveness measures, while yielding the smallest sets of recommended drugs and 26.83% DDI rate reduction from the ground-truth data.},

abstract = {Knowledge based Clinical Decision Support Systems can provide precise and interpretable results for prescription recommendation. Many existing knowledge based prescription recommendation systems take into account multi-modal historical medical events to learn from past experiences. However, such approaches treat those events as independent, static information and neglect the fact that patient history is a set of chronical events. Hence, they lack the ability to extract the dynamics of prescription intentions and cannot provide precise and interpretable results for chronical disease patients with long-term or repeating visits. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Intention Aware Conditional Generation Net (IACoGNet), which introduces an optimized copy-or-predict mechanism to learn precription intentions from multi-modal health datasets and generate drug recommendations. IACoGNet first designs a knowledge representation model that captures multi-modal patient features. Then, it proposes a novel prescription intention representation model in the multi-visit scenario and predicts the diagnostic intention. Finally, it constructs a prescription recommendation framework utilizing the above two knowledge representations. We validate IACoGNet on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show that IACoGNet can achieve optimum in F1 score and average precision.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation systems have gained significant attention in healthcare as a means of providing tailored and effective drug combinations based on patients' clinical information. However, existing approaches often suffer from fairness issues, as recommendations tend to be more accurate for patients with common diseases compared to those with rare conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel model called Robust and Accurate REcommendations for Medication (RAREMed), which leverages the pretrain-finetune learning paradigm to enhance accuracy for rare diseases. RAREMed employs a transformer encoder with a unified input sequence approach to capture complex relationships among disease and procedure codes. Additionally, it introduces two self-supervised pre-training tasks, namely Sequence Matching Prediction (SMP) and Self Reconstruction (SR), to learn specialized medication needs and interrelations among clinical codes. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that RAREMed provides accurate drug sets for both rare and common disease patients, thereby mitigating unfairness in medication recommendation systems. The implementation is available via https://github.com/zzhUSTC2016/RAREMed.},

abstract = {The drug recommendation task aims to predict safe and effective drug prescriptions based on the patients' historical electronic health records (EHRs). However, existing drug recommendation models generally have two limitations. First, they neglect the inherent characteristics of multiple views existing in patients' clinical data (e.g., diagnoses and procedures), leading to fragmented and inconsistent patient representations. Second, they do not fully exploit drug label information. Most models do not explicitly establish a mapping relationship between drug labels and patients' historical visits. To address these two problems, we proposed a label-aware multi-view drug recommendation model named LAMRec. In particular, LAMRec uses a cross-attention module to fuse information from the diagnosis and procedure views, and increases the mutual information of patient multi-view representations through multi-view contrastive loss; the label-wise attention mechanism fully explores drug label information by constructing an adaptive mapping of drug-visit to generate personalized representations that are aware of the drug-related visit information. Experiments on three real world medical datasets demonstrated the superiority of LAMRec, with a relative reduction of 5.25% in DDI compared to the optimal baseline, a relative improvement of 4.20% in Jaccard similarity scores, and a relative improvement of 3.10% in F1 scores. We released the code online at: https://github.com/Tyunsen/LAMRec.},

While there exist a number of recommender systems designed for this problem, we point out that they are challenged in accurately capturing the relation (spec., the degree of relevance) between the current and each of the past visits for the patient when obtaining her current health status, which is the basis for recommending medications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel medication recommendation framework, named VITA, based on the following two novel ideas: (1) relevant-Visit selection; (2) Target-aware Attention. Through extensive experiments using real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of VITA (spec., up to 5.67% higher accuracy, in terms of Jaccard, than the best competitor) and the effectiveness of its two core ideas.

abstract = {Recommending medications with electronic health records (EHRs) is a challenging task for data-driven clinical decision support systems. Most existing models learnt representations for medical concepts based on EHRs and make recommendations with the learnt representations. However, most medications appear in EHR datasets for limited times (the frequency distribution of medications follows power law distribution), resulting in insufficient learning of their representations of the medications. Medical ontologies are the hierarchical classification systems for medical terms where similar terms will be in the same class on a certain level. In this paper, we propose OntoMedRec, the logically-pretrained and model-agnostic medical Ontology Encoders for Medication Recommendation that addresses data sparsity problem with medical ontologies. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world EHR datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of OntoMedRec by integrating it into various existing downstream medication recommendation models. The result shows the integration of OntoMedRec improves the performance of various models in both the entire EHR datasets and the admissions with few-shot medications.

abstract = {Combinatorial medication recommendation (CMR) is a fundamental task of healthcare, which offers opportunities for clinical physicians to provide more precise prescriptions for patients with intricate health conditions, particularly in the scenarios of long-term medical care. Previous research efforts have sought to extract meaningful information from electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate combinatorial medication recommendations. Existing learning-based approaches further consider the chemical structures of medications, but ignore the textual medication descriptions in which the functionalities are clearly described. Furthermore, the textual knowledge derived from the EHRs of patients remains largely underutilized. To address these issues, we introduce the Natural Language-Assisted Multi-modal Medication Recommendation (NLA-MMR), a multimodal alignment framework designed to learn knowledge from the patient view and medication view jointly. Specifically, NLA-MMR formulates CMR as an alignment problem from patient and medication modalities. In this vein, we employ pretrained language models (PLMs) to extract in-domain knowledge regarding patients and medications, serving as the foundational representation for both modalities. In the medication modality, we exploit both chemical structures and textual descriptions to create medication representations. In the patient modality, we generate the patient representations based on textual descriptions of diagnosis, procedure, and symptom. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly accessible datasets demonstrate that NLA-MMR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with a notable average improvement of 4.72% in Jaccard score.},

In this paper, we propose ALGNet, a novel model that leverages light graph convolutional networks (LGCN) and augmentation memory networks (AMN) to enhance medication recommendation. LGCN can efficiently encode the patient records and the DDI graph into low-dimensional embeddings, while AMN can augment the patient representation with external knowledge from a memory module. We evaluate our model on the MIMIC-III dataset and show that it outperforms several baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and DDI avoidance. We also conduct an ablation study to analyze the effects of different components of our model. Our results demonstrate that ALGNet can achieve superior performance with less computation and more interpretability.},

abstract = {The drug recommendation provides safe drug combinations based on the patient’s medical conditions. Existing research efforts have focused on recommending drugs by modeling patient electronic health records and drug side effects knowledge. However, they overlook the importance of drug synergy in drug recommendation, despite the fact that synergistic drug combinations can enhance therapeutic efficacy. To address this gap, we propose the Drug Molecule Synergy-Enhanced Network for Drug Recommendation with Multi-Source Domain Knowledge (DMSDR), which incorporates the concept of drug synergy for the first time. Specifically, we design a drug molecular synergy module to extract drug features at the molecular structure level and learn the interaction information between different drug pairs to identify truly effective drug combinations for patients. Furthermore, we introduce medical external knowledge through a drug synergy interaction graph and model the synergistic effects between drugs using graph convolutional neural networks. To ensure the safety of recommended drugs, we incorporate a contrastive loss function during training to learn both drug synergy and drug interaction features, thereby minimizing potential drug side effects. Extensive experiments conduct on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms multiple baselines and achieves significant performance improvements.

In this work, we introduce a deep learning-based finegrained medication recommendation system called REFINE, which is designed to improve treatment outcomes and minimize adverse drug interactions. In order to better characterize patient's health conditions, we model the trend in medication dosage titrations and lab test responses, and adapt the vision transformer to obtain effective patient representations. We also model drug interaction severity levels as weighted graphs to learn safe drug combinations and design a balanced loss function to avoid overly conservative recommendations and miss medications that might be needed for certain conditions. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets shows that REFINE outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Drug recommendation is an vital mission in the field of intelligent healthcare. Since patients often suffer from multiple diseases and the disease status is dynamic, the model must take drug interactions into account when recommending drugs. However, most existing drug recommendation works only rely on patient electronic health records for medical predictions, current methods do not fully exploit the patient information and their interrelationships when constructing patient narratives, resulting in insufficient completeness of patient narratives. They also overlook the future trend of patient's condition changes, resulting in a high rate of DDI in recommended drug combinations. To work around these limitations, this paper proposes a drug recommendation model that combines attention mechanism and graph encoder. Encode different types of medical codes in patient presentations using access level codes and attention systems. At the same time, a drug graph encoder is designed to extract and encode key information based on the structural features of drug molecules. Comparison with current state-of-the-art basic model, the proposed model achieves a large degree of improvement.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation targets to provide a proper set of medicines according to patients’ diagnoses, which is a critical task in clinics. Currently, the recommendation is manually conducted by doctors. However, for complicated cases, like patients with multiple diseases at the same time, it’s difficult to propose a considerate recommendation even for experienced doctors. This urges the emergence of automatic medication recommendation which can help treat the diagnosed diseases without causing harmful drug-drug interactions. Due to the clinical value, medication recommendation has attracted growing research interests. Existing works mainly formulate medication recommendation as a multi-label classification task to predict the set of medicines. In this paper, we propose the Conditional Generation Net (COGNet) which introduces a novel copy-or-predict mechanism to generate the set of medicines. Given a patient, the proposed model first retrieves his or her historical diagnoses and medication recommendations and mines their relationship with current diagnoses. Then in predicting each medicine, the proposed model decides whether to copy a medicine from previous recommendations or to predict a new one. This process is quite similar to the decision process of human doctors. We validate the proposed model on the public MIMIC data set, and the experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {More and more attention has been paid to electronic medical record (EMR)-based auxiliary diagnosis and treatment, in which medication recommendation is an important research direction. The existing medication recommendation models mainly depend on the data of patients, diagnosis and medications. However, the insufficient amount of clinical data with temporal dependencies becomes a major obstacle. This paper proposes a new knowledge-enhanced pre-training model for medication recommendation. On the one hand, the classification knowledge in diagnostic codes and drug codes is encoded by Graph Attention Network and fused into the clinical data for expanding the data content. On the other hand, a large number of single visit data of EMR are used to create the pre-trained visit model by a modified BERT for expanding the data scale. The experimental results on EMR data from more than 2,000 medical and health institutions in Hainan, China show that the fusion of classification knowledge and pre-training model can effectively improve the accuracy of medication recommendation.},

abstract = {For care of chronic diseases (e.g., depression, diabetes, hypertension), it is critical to identify effective treatment pathways that aim to promptly update the medication following the change of patient state and disease progression. This task is challenging because the optimal treatment pathway for each patient needs to be personalized due to the significant heterogeneity among individuals. Therefore, it is naturally promising to investigate how to use the abundant electronic health records to recommend effective and safe prescriptions. However, prescription recommendation needs to consider multiple aspects of life-critical evidence, such as the information relevance in terms of medical concepts, the health condition in terms of diagnosis history, and the further constraint in terms of side information (e.g., patient demographics and drug side effects). To this end, in this article, we propose a novel prescription recommendation framework named OntoPath to predict the next drug in disease treatment pathways, by building an ontology-aware hierarchical-attention model that integrates multiple medical evidence from domain knowledge guidance, medical history profiling, and side information utilization. Specifically, our method can be characterized from three aspects: (1) by incorporating the longitudinal diagnosis history, we enrich the profiling of patients in terms of comprehensive health conditions, which can largely influence a drug’s outcome on individual patients; (2) using the hierarchical disease and drug ontology structures, we are able to model the domain-specific relevance between patients and drugs at multiple levels of granularity and achieve in-depth collaborative filtering; (3) we introduce a pre-training stage to enhance the discriminativeness of network representations, which helps us obtain a premium model initialization to further boost the final recommendation training. We perform extensive experiments on a large-scale depression cohort with over 37,000 patients from a real-world medical claims database. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of OntoPath through the consistent outperformance over state-of-the-art prescription recommendation baselines and the interpretation of model mechanism in case studies.},

abstract = {AI-empowered drug recommendation has become an important task in healthcare research areas, which offers an additional perspective to assist human doctors with more accurate and more efficient drug prescriptions. Generally, drug recommendation is based on patients' diagnosis results in the electronic health records. We assume that there are three key factors to be addressed in drug recommendation: 1) elimination of recommendation bias due to limitations of observable information, 2) better utilization of historical health condition and 3) coordination of multiple drugs to control safety. To this end, we propose DrugRec, a causal inference based drug recommendation model. The causal graphical model can identify and deconfound the recommendation bias with front-door adjustment. Meanwhile, we model the multi-visit in the causal graph to characterize a patient's historical health conditions. Finally, we model the drug-drug interactions (DDIs) as the propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem, and solving the SAT problem can help better coordinate the recommendation. Comprehensive experiment results show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the widely used datasets MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating the effectiveness and safety of our method.},

abstract = {Recently, drug recommendation tasks have been widely accepted in intelligent healthcare. Most of the existing methods utilize patients’ electronic health records (EHRs) to achieve medical prediction. However, existing algorithms neglect the description of the patient’s health status, which makes it difficult to adapt to the dynamic patients’ condition. And they ignore the intrinsic encoding of drug molecular structure, resulting in the weak performance of drug recommendation. To fill the gap, we propose a molecular graph encoder for drug recommendation named MGEDR to capture the genuine health status of patients. Furthermore, We encode the drug molecular graph and functional groups separately to obtain subtle drug representation. And we design the degree encoder and functional groups encoder to seize the intrinsic features of the molecule efficaciously. Our experimental results show that our proposed MGEDR framework performs significantly better than state-of-the-art baseline methods.},

abstract = {Medicine recommendation systems target to recommend a set of medicines given a set of symptoms which play a crucial role in assisting doctors in their daily clinics. Existing approaches are either rule-based or supervised. However, the former heavily relies on expert labeling, which is time-consuming and costly to collect, and the latter suffers from the data sparse problem. To automate medicine recommendation on sparse data, we propose MedRec, which introduces two graphs in modeling: (1) a knowledge graph connecting diseases, medicines, symptoms, and examinations; (2) an attribute graph connecting medicines via shared attributes and molecular structures. These two graphs enhance the connectivity between symptoms and medicines, which thus alleviate the data sparse problem. By learning the interrelationship between diseases, medicines, symptoms and examinations and the inner relationship within medicine, we can acquire unified embedding representations of symptoms and medicines which can be used in medicine recommendation. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we find that these two tasks: learning graph representation and medical recommendation can benefit each other.},

However, existing works on drug recommendation either do not take the critical impact of doses on treatment outcomes into account, or neglect the patient’s personalized history and drug-drug interactions, resulting in suboptimal recommendation results. To fill these gaps, we propose a novel Temporal Prescription Generation (TPG) model in this paper. Specifically, we first utilize a message passing neural network to capture the interaction between drugs, combined with a decomposed long and short-term memory (LSTM-DE) to characterize patient’s general information. Then, we design a prescription generator based on recurrent neural network to generate drugs and estimate doses simultaneously. Experimental results on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the best existing models in terms of drug recommendation and dose estimation.},

Moreover, they usually rely on complex medical records (such as history treatment records, diagnosis, lab tests, and procedures) to learn the representation of symptoms and drugs. To address these issues, we propose Multi-view Graph Representation Learning via Mutual Learning for Drug Recommendation (MGRL-DR), a novel method that only requires the symptom condition of patients and can capture the item-level and set-level interaction between symptoms and drugs via collaborative learning. Our framework will construct three graphs: symptom-drug interaction graph, symptom set-drug interaction graph, and drug set-symptom interaction graph, and train three graph-based information extraction modules in a single stage to capture the item-level and set-level semantic information of symptoms and drugs simultaneously. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the significant improvements of MGRL-DR over the state-of-the-art methods.},

To address the above problems, we propose a research method for drug recommendation based on feature interaction and graph convolution. First, we introduce a knowledge graph (KG) of drugs and perform feature extraction by graph convolution algorithm, which effectively captures the correlation between the neighbourhoods of medicines. Second, we enrich the vector representation of users and drugs by obtaining node information of users and drugs through a heterogeneous propagation layer and employing a knowledge-aware attention mechanism to distinguish the contributions of tail entities in different triples. In addition, we use a two-mechanism approach to dynamically learn the vector representations of users, which improves the recommendation effect of the model. Finally, the user feature vectors and drug feature vectors are fed into the prediction module to obtain the interaction probability between the user and the drug. Compared with other state-of-the-art mainstream models, the accuracy of the proposed model on drugs dataset and Book-Crossing dataset is improved by 1.01% and 0.8%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has high recommendation accuracy and superior overall performance.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation is attracting enormous attention due to its promise in effectively prescribing medicines and improving the survival rate of patients. Among all challenges, drug–drug interactions (DDI) related to undesired duplication, antagonism, or alternation between drugs could lead to fatal side effects. Previous researches usually provide models with DDI knowledge to achieve DDI reduction. However, the mixed use of patients with different DDI rates places stringent requirements on the generalization performance of models. In pursuit of a more effective method, we propose the adversarially regularized model for medication recommendation (ARMR). Specifically, ARMR firstly models temporal information from medical records to obtain patient representations and builds a key-value memory network based on information from historical admissions. Then, ARMR carries out multi-hop reading on the memory network to recommend medications. Meanwhile, ARMR uses a GAN model to adversarially regulate the distribution of patient representations by matching the distribution to a desired Gaussian distribution to achieve DDI reduction. Comparative evaluations between ARMR and baselines show that ARMR outperforms all baselines in terms of medication recommendation, achieving DDI reduction regardless of numbers of DDI types being considered.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation systems are developed to recommend suitable medications tailored to specific patient. Previous researches primarily focus on learning medication representations, which have yielded notable advances. However, these methods are limited to capturing personalized patient representations due to the following primary limitations: (i) unable to capture the differences in the impact of diseases/procedures on patients across various patient health states; (ii) fail to model the direct causal relationships between medications and specific health state of patients, resulting in an inability to determine which specific disease each medication is treating. To address these limitations, we propose CausalMed, a patient health state-centric model capable of enhancing the personalization of patient representations. Specifically, CausalMed first captures the causal relationship between diseases/procedures and medications through causal discovery and evaluates their causal effects. Building upon this, CausalMed focuses on analyzing the health state of patients, capturing the dynamic differences of diseases/procedures in different health states of patients, and transforming diseases/procedures into medications on direct causal relationships. Ultimately, CausalMed integrates information from longitudinal visits to recommend medication combinations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our method learns more personalized patient representation and outperforms state-of-the-art models in accuracy and safety.},

abstract = {Drug recommendation is an AI healthcare task that has become increasingly important during the current COVID-19 pandemic. At present, the accumulation of a large number of electronic health records (EHR) provides strong data support for medical and scientific researchers. Most existing work uses splicing diagnosis and procedure to complete the recommendation task while ignoring the problem that the patient’s diagnosis and procedure information are recorded in different levels of detail. Moreover, the splicing of different medical records cannot accurately characterize the patient’s condition, thus reducing the accuracy of recommended drugs. In this paper, we propose a drug recommendation model, DKFM, which introduces a molecular knowledge-guided dual-level drug fusion mechanism. DKFM can integrate a patient’s diagnosis and procedure important information and determine the impact on the current condition. Then the diagnosis and procedure information was respectively injected into the drug functional group encoder to obtain two candidate drug sets. Finally, select the drugs that are really suitable for the patient’s condition at the sets level and the score matrix level as the final recommended drugs. We validate DKFM on the public MIMIC-III dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Medication recommendation aiming at accurate prescription is a significant clinical application that assists caregivers in professional practice of medicine, and obtaining informative patient representations plays an important role in building effective recommendation models. Meanwhile, conducting attentive multi-hop reading on Memory Neural Network (MemNN) that stores knowledge from previous admissions is widely applied to derive contextual patterns for accurate patient representations. However, regular attentive reading may repeatedly attend to the same slots of MemNN. Although the coverage mechanism is proposed to tackle the problem, it is based on the assumption that there is one-to-one alignment between source information and target outputs, which medical records do not follow. In pursuit of a valuable model for medication recommendation, we propose the Multi-hop Reading with Selective Coverage (MRSC). MRSC firstly conducts information selection on MemNN based on the coverage of each slot. Then the method involves coverage into the attention calculation during the multi-hop reading on MemNN, making sure that all important historical records is fully utilized by balancing attention within selected information. Experiments on real-world clinical dataset demonstrate that MRSC successfully derives informative patient representations for the recommendation by conducting selection on MemNN and limiting attention adjustment within selected information.},

abstract = {Recently, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to benefit many machine learning applications in multiple domains (e.g. self-driving, agriculture, bio-medicine, recommender systems, etc.). However, KGs suffer from incompleteness, which motivates the task of KG completion which consists of inferring new (unobserved) links between existing entities based on observed links. This task is achieved using either a probabilistic, rule-based, or embedding-based approach. The latter has been shown to consistently outperform the former approaches. It however relies on negative sampling, which supposes that every observed link is “true” and that every unobserved link is “false”. Negative sampling increases the computation complexity of the learning process and introduces noise in the learning. We propose NSF-KGE, a framework for KG embedding that does not require negative sampling, yet achieves performance comparable to that of the negative sampling-based approach. NSF-KGE employs objectives from the non-contrastive self-supervised literature to learn representations that are invariant to relation transformations (e.g. translation, scaling, rotation etc) while avoiding representation collapse.},

abstract = {The Traditional Chinese Medicine Health Status Identification plays an important role in TCM diagnosis and prescription recommendation. In this paper, we propose a method of Status Identification via Graph Attention Network, named SIGAT, which captures the complex medical correlation in the symptom-syndrome graph. More specifically, we construct a symptom-syndrome graph in that symptoms are taken as nodes and the edges are connected by syndromes. And we realize automatic induction of symptom to state element classification by using the attention mechanism and perceptron classifier. Finally, we conduct experiments by using hamming loss, coverage, 0/1 error, ranking loss, average precision, macro-F1 score, and micro-F1 score as evaluation metrics. The results demonstrate that the SIGAT model outperforms comparison algorithms on Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescription Dictionary dataset. The case study results suggest that the proposed method is a valuable way to identify the state element. The application of the graph attention network classification algorithm in TCM health status identification is of high precision and methodological feasibility.},

abstract = {Molecular structures and Drug-Drug Interactions (DDI) are recognized as important knowledge to guide medication recommendation (MR) tasks, and medical concept embedding has been applied to boost their performance. Though promising performance has been achieved by leveraging Graph Neural Network (GNN) models to encode the molecular structures of medications or/and DDI, we observe that existing models are still defective: 1) to differentiate medications with similar molecules but different functionality; or/and 2) to properly capture the unintended reactions between drugs in the embedding space. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Carmen, a cautiously designed graph embedding-based MR framework. Carmen consists of four components, including patient representation learning, context information extraction, context-aware GNN, and DDI encoding. Carmen incorporates the visit history into the representation learning of molecular graphs to distinguish molecules with similar topology but dissimilar activity. Its DDI encoding module is specially devised for the non-transitive interaction DDI graphs. The experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Carmen achieves remarkable performance improvement over state-of-the-art models and can improve the safety of recommended drugs with proper DDI graph encoding.},

abstract = {Recommendation systems combining Graph Neural Networks and Knowledge Graphs have been successfully applied in various domains. However, most existing approaches only consider one-to-one or one-to-many user-item interactions and cannot cater to many-to-many recommendation scenarios, such as providing prescriptions based on clinical diagnosis and medical history. Providing such a recommendation requires considering the implicit interaction within input user features as well as output candidates. In this paper, we propose a two-stage knowledge graph attention aggregation mechanism that helps recommend drug combinations for a patient based on his conditions. First, a disease-drug interaction graph is constructed and integrated with the medical domain knowledge, forming a collaborative knowledge graph. Secondly, an intra-feature attention aggregation is performed to obtain the representations of diseases and drugs based on drug-drug and disease-disease interactions, respectively. Thirdly, an inter-feature attention aggregation is performed using the disease-drug interaction to better represent a user's condition. Finally, the user's condition representation is concatenated with other user features to generate the final user representation for the prescription recommendation. Experiments with realistic datasets show that our approach can outperform existing recommendation systems by 4.3% and 6.1% in precision and recall, respectively.},

According to CDC reports, more than 250,000 people die by medication error; for that matter, many deep learning models were previously proposed to solve the high order correlations of diabetic medicine for diabetic patients.

This study proposes a recommendation method called (Diabetes Medicine Recommendation System) DIMERS model, which combines a prior medical knowledge of doctors with bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). In this study, DIMERS, first, preprocesses general tests of diabetic patient test results and medicines with a complex data achievement strategy. After that, we use a weighted block with prior medical knowledge to enhance the learning and explainable abilities of deep neural networks (DNN). Our study's overall performance was excellent. We train and validate using the real world Ruijin hospital and drug bank datasets that contain 25,280 patients within three months gaps and 63 types of diabetes medicines.},

abstract = {Recommending medication combinations for patients is an essential part of artificial intelligence in the healthcare field. Existing approaches improve the effect of recommendations by considering how to make full use of patients’ electronic health records or by introducing additional external knowledge, but there is still room for improving the fusion of heterogeneous and diverse knowledge and the effect between accuracy and drug-drug interaction (DDI) rate. To fill this gap, we propose the Feature Fusion and Bipartite Decision Networks (FFBDNet) to leverage external knowledge and improve accuracy and DDI rate. FFBDNet is equipped with a patient feature encoder which extract useful information from current and historical visits of patient to supplement the patient’s health status, a medication feature encoder which can easily fuse the heterogeneous and diverse external knowledge of medications as feature, and a bipartite decision module to give medication recommendation results. FFBDNet also has a greedy loss function to improve accuracy and DDI rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FFBDNet by comparing with several state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset. FFBDNet outperformed all baselines in all effective measures, reduced relatively the DDI rate by 97.65% from existing EHR data, and also is shown to improve 1.02% on Jaccard similarity.},

abstract = {Recommender models trained on historical observational data alone can be brittle when domain experts subject them to counterfactual evaluation. In many domains, experts can articulate common, high-level mappings or rules between categories of inputs (user's history) and categories of outputs (preferred recommendations). One challenge is to determine how to train recommender models to adhere to these rules. In this work, we introduce the goal of domain-specific concordance: the expectation that a recommender model follow a set of expert-defined categorical rules. We propose a regularization-based approach that optimizes for robustness on rule-based input perturbations. To test the effectiveness of this method, we apply it in a medication recommender model over diagnosis-medicine categories, and in movie and music recommender models, on rules over categories based on movie tags and song genres. We demonstrate that we can increase the category-based robustness distance by up to 126% without degrading accuracy, but rather increasing it by up to 12% compared to baseline models in the popular MIMIC-III, MovieLens-20M and Last.fm Million Song datasets.},

abstract = {Traditional medical prescriptions based on physical paper-based documents are prone to manipulation, errors, and unauthorized reproduction due to their format. Addressing the limitations of the traditional prescription system, e-prescription systems have been introduced in several countries. However, e-prescription systems lead to several concerns like the risk of privacy loss, the problem of double-spending prescriptions, lack of interoperability, and single point of failure, all of which need to be addressed immediately. We propose an AI-assisted blockchain-enabled smart and secure e-prescription management framework to address these issues. Our proposed system overcomes the problems of the centralized e-prescription systems and enables efficient consent management to access prescriptions by incorporating blockchain-based smart contracts. Our work incorporates the Umbral proxy re-encryption scheme in the proposed system, avoiding the need for repeated encryption and decryption of the prescriptions when transferred between different entities in the network. In our work, we employ two different machine learning models(Random Forest classifier and LightGBM classifier) to assist the doctor in prescribing medicines. One is a drug recommendation model, which is aimed at providing drug recommendations considering the medical history of the patients and the general prescription pattern for the particular ailment of the patient. We have fine-tuned the SciBERT model for adverse drug reaction detection. The extensive experimentation and results show that the proposed e-prescription framework is secure, scalable, and interoperable. Further, the proposed machine learning models produce results higher than 95%.},

abstract = {Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is the main route of disease control for ancient Chinese. Through thousands of years' development and inheriting, TCM is the most influential traditional medical system which lasts the longest time and used by the largest population. However, there are still much space for data driven TCM information process to take advantage of for real medical application. In this paper, we propose a statistical diagnosis approach to find out the pathogenesises based on the latent semantic analysis of symptoms and the corresponding herbs. We assume that the latent pathogenesis is the inherent connection between symptoms and herbs within a medical case. We therefore develop a novel multi-content model based on LDA. Then three prescription recommendation algorithms are proposed focusing on permanent cure, symptom alleviation and both. We used the proposed model to analyze two TCM domains amenorrhea and lung cancer. Experiment results illustrate that the pathogenesises found by our model correspond well with the theory of TCM and the proposed model provides a theoretical data-driven way to establish diagnosis standards. And the prescription recommendation algorithms help doctor make treatment more accurately, which can lead the development of diagnosis of TCM.},

abstract = {Many traditional drug prediction models mostly focus on analyzing single omics data, while ignoring the rich multi-omics data in bioinformatics. Moreover, they failed to make full use of the drug complementary information of sequence features and graphical features when considering the SMILES(Simplified molecular input line entry system) features. In view of this, we propose a deep learning model GSDRP that effectively integrates omics data and drug attribute information. SA-BiLSTM is used to extract one-dimensional sequence features of drugs, and Graph Transformer and GAT_GCN capture two-dimensional structural features, which are then fused by the graph sequence attention module. At the same time, the omics data features are processed by convolutional neural network. Finally, the cross-attention module in GSDRP facilitates the fusion of omics and drug features to enhance interactions for better prediction. Experiments on the Cancer Drug Sensitivity Database (GDSC) show that GSDRP can effectively combine multi-omics information such as genome aberration (MUT_CNA) and gene expression (GE) with the 1-D and 2-D features of SMILES to significantly improve the accuracy of drug response prediction. The comparison results with four other state-of-the-art methods further demonstrate the superior performance of GSDRP in drug response prediction. In addtion,we identify important omics markers and important characteristics of drugs that affect HCC celllines response prediction. This will not only help to understand the therapeutic mechanism of hepatocellular carcinoma, but also provide strong support for future individualized treatment.},

abstract = {Combinatorial drug recommendation involves recommending a personalized combination of medication (drugs) to a patient over his/her longitudinal history, which essentially aims at solving a combinatorial optimization problem that pursues high accuracy under the safety constraint. Among existing learning-based approaches, the association between drug substructures (i.e., a sub-graph of the molecule that contributes to certain chemical effect) and the target disease is largely overlooked, though the function of drugs in fact exhibits strong relevance with particular substructures. To address this issue, we propose a molecular substructure-aware encoding method entitled MoleRec that entails a hierarchical architecture aimed at modeling inter-substructure interactions and individual substructures’ impact on patient’s health condition, in order to identify those substructures that really contribute to healing patients. Specifically, MoleRec learns to attentively pooling over substructure representations which will be element-wisely re-scaled by the model’s inferred relevancy with a patient’s health condition to obtain a prior-knowledge-informed drug representation. We further design a weight annealing strategy for drug-drug-interaction (DDI) objective to adaptively control the balance between accuracy and safety criteria throughout training. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. four accuracy and safety metrics.

However, it is a serious issue to purchase medicine blindly without necessary medication guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel cloud-assisted drug recommendation (CADRE), which can recommend users with top-N related medicines according to symptoms. In CADRE, we first cluster the drugs into several groups according to the functional description information, and design a basic personalized drug recommendation based on user collaborative filtering. Then, considering the shortcomings of collaborative filtering algorithm, such as computing expensive, cold start, and data sparsity, we propose a cloud-assisted approach for enriching end-user Quality of Experience (QoE) of drug recommendation, by modeling and representing the relationship of the user, symptom and medicine via tensor decomposition. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated with experimental study based on a real dataset crawled from Internet.},

abstract = {Background: Sepsis is an acute disease with high mortality and morbidity. Early and adequate drug therapy is critical when treating patients with sepsis. Individualized treatment of sepsis is crucial considering the different patient's phenotypes. Therefore, this paper aims to guide physicians to better individualize the treatment plan for their patients by developing a medical prediction model to predict the mortality rate of the patient and the recommended medication for the patient.Methods: The main methods used in this paper are Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, which are used to build a mortality prediction model using the indicators of ICU patients combined with the deaths of ICU patients, and to derive the effect of medications on the deaths of the patients.Results: The best predictive model for mortality was Extreme Gradient Boosting, with an accuracy of 0.802. Extreme Gradient Boosting also fitted the best drug prediction model with an accuracy of 0.867 in terms of heparin prediction.Conclusions: The paper concluded with machine learning methods to develop a prediction model for medication use in sepsis patients and showed 17 vital signs that affect mortality, including age, respiratory rate, etc. Also, Heparin, Acetaminophen, and Metoprolol Tartrate effectively treat sepsis patients. Norepinephrine, cefepime, and furosemide are related to high mortality because most uses are on severe patients. Hydromorphone is the drug that indeed increases mortality.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the task of ranking individuals based on the potential benefit of being "treated" (e.g. by a drug or exposure to recommendations or ads), referred to as Uplift Modeling in the literature. This application has gained a surge of interest in recent years and it is found in many applications such as personalized medicine, recommender systems or targeted advertising. In real life scenarios the capacity of models to rank individuals by potential benefit is measured by the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC), a ranking metric related to the well known Area Under ROC Curve. In the case where the objective function, for learning model parameters, is different from AUUC, the capacity of the resulting system to generalize on AUUC is limited. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn a model that directly optimizes an upper bound on AUUC. To find such a model we first develop a generalization bound on AUUC and then derive from it a learning objective called AUUC-max, usable with linear and deep models. We empirically study the tightness of this generalization bound, its effectiveness for hyperparameters tuning and show the efficiency of the proposed learning objective compared to a wide range of competitive baselines on two classical uplift modeling benchmarks using real-world datasets.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of massive electronic medical records, which highly support intelligent medical services such as drug recommendation. However, although there are multiple interaction types between drugs, e.g., synergism and antagonism, which can influence the effect of a drug package significantly, prior arts generally neglect the interaction between drugs or consider only a single type of interaction. Moreover, most existing studies generally formulate the problem of package recommendation as getting a personalized scoring function for users, despite the limits of discriminative models to achieve satisfactory performance in practical applications. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel end-to-end Drug Package Generation (DPG) framework, which develops a new generative model for drug package recommendation that considers the interaction effects between drugs that are affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we propose to formulate the drug package generation as a sequence generation process. Along this line, we first initialize the drug interaction graph based on medical records and domain knowledge. Then, we design a novel message-passing neural network to capture the drug interaction, as well as a drug package generator based on a recurrent neural network. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and the deep reinforcement learning technique is leveraged to reduce the dependence on the drug order. Finally, extensive experiments on a real-world dataset from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPG framework compared with several competitive baseline methods.},

abstract = {Background. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a cardiovascular disease of unknown etiology with progressive aggravation. More and more studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an essential role in dilated cardiomyopathy formation and development. The mechanism of action of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks formed based on the principle that lncRNAs affect mRNAs’ expression level by competitively binding microRNAs (miRNAs) in dilated cardiomyopathy has rarely been reported. Objective. This study is aimed at constructing a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network by bioinformatics analysis methods, discovering, and validating potential biomarkers of DCM in the ceRNA network and determining possible therapeutic targets from them for drug prediction. Methods. A lncRNA dataset and a mRNA microarray dataset were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus Database (GEO). Gene expression was compared between blood samples from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and blood samples from normal subjects to identify differential expression of lncRNAs and mRNAs. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed using bioinformatics tools, and functional and pathway enrichment analysis and protein-protein interactions were performed. The mRNAs in the network and the proteins they encode are then used as targets for predicting drugs. Besides, the expression of lncRNAs in the ceRNA network was validated by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) experiments in vitro. Results. The differentially expressed lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network in dilated cardiomyopathy was successfully established. Two differentially overexpressed key lncRNAs were found from the network: AC093817 and AC091062, and qRT-PCR experiments further validated the overexpression of AC093817 and AC091062. The mRNAs in the network and the proteins encoded by the mRNAs were used for drug prediction to get related drugs. Conclusion. This study supports a possible mechanism and drug development of dilated cardiomyopathy, AC093817 and AC091062 being potential biomarkers of dilated cardiomyopathy.},

abstract = {Background. Accumulating evidence shows that the innate immune system is a key player in cardiovascular repair and regeneration, but little is known about the role of immune-related genes (IRGs) in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Methods. The differential mRNA expression profiles of HCM samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset (GSE89714), and the IRG expression profile was obtained from the ImmPort database. The regulatory pathways of IRGs in HCM were screened out through discrepantly expressive genes (DEGs) analysis, enrichment of gene function/pathway analysis, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Besides, hub IRGs in the PPI network were selected for drug prediction. Results. A total of 854 genes were differentially expressed in HCM, of which 88 were IRGs. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that 88 IRGs were mainly involved in the biological processes (BP) of SMAD protein pathway, smooth muscle cell proliferation, protein serine/threonine kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGFβ signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and MAPK signaling pathway were enriched in the pathway enrichment analysis of these 88 IRGs. Furthermore, the PPI regulatory network of IRGs was constructed, and 10 hub IRGs were screened out to construct a regulatory network for HCM. 4 transcription factors (TFs) were the major regulator of 10 hub IRGs. Finally, these 10 hub IRGs were entered into the pharmacogenomics database for prediction, and the relevant drugs were obtained. Conclusions. In this study, 10 hub IRGs were coexpressed with 4 TFs to construct a regulatory network for HCM. Drug prediction of these 10 hub IRGs proposed potential therapeutic agents that could be used in HCM. These results indicate that IRGs are potential regulators and drug therapeutic targets in HCM.},

abstract = {Smart Chinese medicine has emerged to contribute to the evolution of healthcare and medical services by applying machine learning together with advanced computing techniques like cloud computing to computer-aided diagnosis and treatment in the health engineering and informatics. Specifically, smart Chinese medicine is considered to have the potential to treat difficult and complicated diseases such as diabetes and cancers. Unfortunately, smart Chinese medicine has made very limited progress in the past few years. In this paper, we present a unified smart Chinese medicine framework based on the edge-cloud computing system. The objective of the framework is to achieve computer-aided syndrome differentiation and prescription recommendation, and thus to provide pervasive, personalized, and patient-centralized services in healthcare and medicine. To accomplish this objective, we integrate deep learning and deep reinforcement learning into the traditional Chinese medicine. Furthermore, we propose a multi-modal deep computation model for syndrome recognition that is a crucial part of syndrome differentiation. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the proposed model by comparing with the staked auto-encoder and multi-modal deep learning model for syndrome recognition of hypertension and cold.},

abstract = {Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is well-known for its unique theory and effective treatment for complicated diseases. In TCM theory, “pathogenesis” is the cause of patient’s disease symptoms and is the basis for prescribing herbs. However, the essence of pathogenesis analysis is not well depicted by current researches. In this paper, we propose a novel topic model called Multi-Content embedding LDA (MC-eLDA), aiming to collaboratively capture the relationships of symptom-pathogenesis-herb triples, relationship between symptom-symptom, and relationship between herb-herb, which can be used in auxiliary diagnosis and treatment. By projecting discrete symptom words and herb words into two continuous semantic spaces respectively, the semantic equivalence can be encoded by exploiting the contiguity of their corresponding embeddings. Compared with previous models, topic coherence in each pathogenesis cluster can be promoted. Pathogenesis structures that previous topic modeling can not capture can be discovered by MC-eLDA. Then a herb prescription recommendation method is conducted based on MC-eLDA. Experimental results on two real-world TCM medical cases datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model for analyzing pathogenesis as well as helping make diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice.},

abstract = {In recent years, sequential learning has been of great interest due to the advance of deep learning with applications in time-series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved superior performance in single-view and synchronous multi-view sequential learning comparing to traditional machine learning models. However, the method remains less explored in asynchronous multi-view sequential learning, and the unalignment nature of multiple sequences poses a great challenge to learn the inter-view interactions. We develop an AMANet (Attention and Memory-Augmented Networks) architecture by integrating both attention and memory to solve asynchronous multi-view learning problem in general, and we focus on experiments in dual-view sequences in this paper. Self-attention and inter-attention are employed to capture intra-view interaction and inter-view interaction, respectively. History attention memory is designed to store the historical information of a specific object, which serves as local knowledge storage. Dynamic external memory is used to store global knowledge for each view. We evaluate our model in three tasks: medication recommendation from a patient's medical records, diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification from a hospital record, and invoice fraud detection through a company's taxation behaviors. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms all baselines and other state-of-the-art models in all tasks. Moreover, the ablation study of our model indicates that the inter-attention mechanism plays a key role in the model and it can boost the predictive power by effectively capturing the inter-view interactions from asynchronous views.},

abstract = {Medicine recommendation denotes the task of predicting drug combinations for patients’ therapies in case of complex diseases such as cancer or diabetes. These patients often follow a treatment consisting of multiple drugs simultaneously. Previous research works have already made predictions of next drug combinations based on the integration of the patients’ health records with an adverse drug–drug interaction (DDI) knowledge graph in order to minimize drug side effects. However, they missed to consider additional valuable information coming from synergistic drug–drug interaction knowledge graphs. In this paper, we integrate Electronic Health Record graph data incorporating patient, disease, therapy and drug information with either a synergistic or an adverse DDI knowledge graph to recommend safe and explainable medications. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to compare three different medical data integration strategies based on the analysis stage (i.e. early, intermediate and late) at which integration takes place. By identifying those drugs that either complement each other or behave adversely, we are able to improve the efficacy of the patient’s therapy and/or minimize the toxicity and side effects. Moreover, we develop models to support doctors in comprehensively screening candidate drugs and their possible substitutes by providing also robust explanations alongside with the recommended medicine. We run experiments with three real-life medical data sets. In terms of suggesting safe and effective drugs, our proposed method suggests 34 times more synergistic drugs than the baseline algorithm for the cancer data set and reduces the unwanted side effects to patients’ medication by 2350 times more than the baseline algorithm for the MIMIC III data set. Our results demonstrate that we can assist doctors to prescribe effective, safe and explainable medication for the patients’ treatment.},

abstract = {Drug-target interactions prediction is of great significance in medical and biological research, but traditional laboratory methods have disadvantages such as high cost and time-consuming. Therefore, in recent years, deep learning, similarity calculation methods and other methods are becoming more and more widely applied to related research. This paper proposes an improved deep learning model, named as FPConv-DTI, which uses the fingerprint information of drug and the evolution feature information of protein based on a convolutional neural network. The Borderline-SMOTE algorithm is also used to generate new positive examples for training to solve the imbalance problem, and combines the number of sample data to process the input differently. Experiments have been carried out with four standard datasets and Drugbank dataset. The results show that compared with other methods, our method has greatly improvement for predicting drug-target interactions. In addition, some COVID-19 drugs are also predicted with the best-performing model, which shows that FPConv-DTI model is the potential for practical drug prediction.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the rapid accumulation of massive electronic medical records (EMRs), which highly support the intelligent medical services such as drug recommendation. However, prior arts mainly follow the traditional recommendation strategies like collaborative filtering, which usually treat individual drugs as mutually independent, while the latent interactions among drugs, e.g., synergistic or antagonistic effect, have been largely ignored. To that end, in this paper, we target at developing a new paradigm for drug package recommendation with considering the interaction effect within drugs, in which the interaction effects could be affected by patient conditions. Specifically, we first design a pre-training method based on neural collaborative filtering to get the initial embedding of patients and drugs. Then, the drug interaction graph will be initialized based on medical records and domain knowledge. Along this line, we propose a new Drug Package Recommendation (DPR) framework with two variants, respectively DPR on Weighted Graph (DPR-WG) and DPR on Attributed Graph (DPR-AG) to solve the problem, in which each the interactions will be described as signed weights or attribute vectors. In detail, a mask layer is utilized to capture the impact of patient condition, and graph neural networks (GNNs) are leveraged for the final graph induction task to embed the package. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set from a first-rate hospital demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPR framework compared with several competitive baseline methods, and further support the heuristic study for the drug package generation task with adequate performance.},

Dimensionality reduction is a necessary and important task for getting the best features in next step. In this paper, three important attribute data about the drugs (i.e., chemical structures, target proteins and side effects) are selected, and two deep frameworks named as F1 and F2 are used to accomplish the task of dimensionality reduction. The processed data are used for recommending new indications by collaborative filtering algorithm. In order to compare the results, two important values of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coverage are selected to evaluate the performance of the two frameworks. Through the comparison with the results of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), it shows that the two deep frameworks proposed in this paper perform better than PCA and can be used for dimensionality reduction task in the future in drug repositioning.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that almost one-third of the world's adult population are suffering from hypertension which has gradually become a "silent killer". Due to the varieties of anti-hypertensive drugs, patients are interested in how these drugs can be selected to match their respective conditions. This study provides a personalized recommendation service system of anti-hypertensive drugs based on context-awareness and designs a context ontology framework of the service. In addition, this paper introduces a Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)-based rule to provide high-level context reasoning and information recommendation and to overcome the limitation of ontology reasoning. To make the information recommendation of the drugs more personalized, this study also devises three categories of information recommendation rules that match different priority levels and uses a ranking algorithm to optimize the recommendation. The experiment conducted shows that combining the anti-hypertensive drugs personalized recommendation service context ontology (HyRCO) with the optimized rule reasoning can achieve a higher-quality personalized drug recommendation service. Accordingly this exploratory study of the personalized recommendation service for hypertensive drugs and its method can be easily adopted for other diseases.},

Preventive medicine is definitely the key to combat NCDs; however, the cost of preventive programs is a critical issue affecting the popularization of these medicine programs in developing countries. In this study, we investigate predictive modeling for providing a low-cost preventive medicine program. In our two-year-long field study in Bangladesh, we collected the health checkup results of 15,075 subjects, the data of 6,607 prescriptions, and the follow-up examination results of 2,109 subjects. We address three prediction problems, namely subject risk prediction, drug recommendation, and future risk prediction, by using machine learning techniques; our multiple-classifier approach successfully reduced the costs of health checkups, a multi-task learning method provided accurate recommendation for specific types of drugs, and an active learning method achieved an efficient assignment of healthcare workers for the follow-up care of subjects.},

abstract = {Medicine Combination Prediction (MCP) based on Electronic Health Record (EHR) can assist doctors to prescribe medicines for complex patients. Previous studies on MCP either ignore the correlations between medicines (i.e., MCP is formulated as a binary classifcation task), or assume that there is a sequential correlation between medicines (i.e., MCP is formulated as a sequence prediction task). The latter is unreasonable because the correlations between medicines should be considered in an order-free way. Importantly, MCP must take additional medical knowledge (e.g., Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI)) into consideration to ensure the safety of medicine combinations. However, most previous methods for MCP incorporate DDI knowledge with a post-processing scheme, which might undermine the integrity of proposed medicine combinations. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional reinforcement learning model for MCP, named Combined Order-free Medicine Prediction Network (CompNet), that addresses the issues listed above. CompNet casts the MCP task as an order-free Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and designs a Deep Q Learning (DQL) mechanism to learn correlative and adverse interactions between medicines. Specifcally, we frst use a Dual Convolutional Neural Network (Dual-CNN) to obtain patient representations based on EHRs. Then, we introduce the medicine knowledge associated with predicted medicines to create a dynamic medicine knowledge graph, and use a Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) to encode it. Finally, CompNet selects medicines by fusing the combination of patient information and the medicine knowledge graph. Experiments on a benchmark dataset, i.e., MIMIC-III, demonstrate that CompNet signifcantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and improves a recently proposed model by 3.74%pt, 6.64%pt in terms of Jaccard and F1 metrics.},

abstract = {Predicting new drug target interactions experimentally through wet lab experiments is time as well as resource intensive. In general, drug-target interaction prediction problem leads to drug discovery, drug repositioning and uncovers interesting patterns in chemogenomics research. Drug and target represent heterogeneous nodes within a network of interactions. Presence of an edge between the nodes indicates a positive interaction whereas an absence suggests an unknown interaction. Classification based machine learning algorithms are heavily applied in this area of research. Classification algorithms need positive as well as negative data to yield optimized results. The major problem in this field is lack of negative data because the data that are found in the public databases are positive interaction samples. Considering unknown drug target pairs as negative data may cause severe consequences for the prediction performance. Thereby, we propose a positive un-labelled (PU) learning- based approach that uses one class support vector machine technique as the learning algorithm. The algorithm learns the positive distribution from the unified feature vector space of drugs and targets and regards unknown pairs as unlabeled instead of labelling them as negative pairs. Additionally, we use 4860 Klekota Roth fingerprint + 881 PubChem fingerprint as a high dimensional and highly discriminative feature vector representation for drugs. To represent protein features, we create a protein-motif matrix based on the sliding window score that records the probability of a motif pattern occurring within a given protein sequence. Also, we separately evaluate the prediction performance using 5-fold nested cross- validation under different experimental setting for each of the four formulations: 1) Known drug-target pair,2) Drug prediction, 3) Target prediction and 4) Unknown drug target pair. We show that our approach yields the best AUC score over previous benchmark techniques and outperforms most of the recent works based on one class classifiers and PU-based learning.},
