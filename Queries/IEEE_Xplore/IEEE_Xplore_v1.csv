However, the following conditions may have been ignored: 1) A more compact encoder for intra-relationship in the intra-visit medical event is urgent; 2) Strategies for learning accurate representations of the variable longitudinal sequences of patients are different. In this article, we proposed a novel Sample-adaptive Hierarchical medicAtion Prediction nEtwork, termed SHAPE, to tackle the above challenges in the medication recommendation task.

However, existing research has not taken into account the patients’ intention to visit the doctor and the similarities between patients’ visit intentions. In this study, we employ medical order data in both prescription intention modeling and patient similarity analysis, subsequently integrating these to generate more personalized and accurate prescription recommendations. The cross-attention mechanism is first employed to focus the representation of the patient’s health status on the patient’s chief complaints, with the objective of predicting treatment intention and, subsequently, the prescriptions. Subsequently, when we learn from the successful treatment experiences of similar patients, we focus more on the similarities of their chief complaints. The experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our method achieves optimal performance in terms of Jaccard score, PRAUC, F1 score and average precision, with relative improvements of 7%, 5%, 4%, and 8% respectively, in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3459080","Regional Comprehensive Application Demonstration of Digital Intelligence Technology for Active Health Services(grant numbers:2023YFC3605800); Construction and Application of Early Diagnosis and Prediction Model for Gestational Diabetes Based on Multimodal Information(grant numbers:BE2023781); Key Research and Development Program of Wuhan(grant numbers:2022012202015070); “Selective Candidate” Joint Research Fund of Wuhan East Lake High-Tech Development District(grant numbers:2022KJB126); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10679140","Prescription recommendation;electronic health record;patient similarity analysis;attention mechanism","Medical diagnostic imaging;Drugs;Diseases;Electronic medical records;Codes;Hospitals;Attention mechanisms","","","","31","CCBY","12 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most existing methods either only make recommendation through EHRs of the current admission while ignoring the patient's historical records, or fail to fully consider the correlations among the clinical events from every single admission. These methods have shown their limitations in dealing with the complex structural correlations and temporal dependencies of clinical events in EHRs, which results in the defect of recommendation quality as well as the lack of temporal prediction ability. For that, a novel graph-attention augmented temporal neural network is proposed to model both the structural and temporal information simultaneously. For each admission record, a co-occurrence graph is constructed to establish the correlations among clinical events, and then a graph-attention augmented mechanism is used to learn the structural correlations on the graphs to obtain better representation of this admission. Then a temporal updating module based on the gated recurrent units is further proposed to learn the temporal dependencies between multiple admissions of each patient. Furthermore, our proposed model is also constrained by the co-occurrence graph, which can capture the internal correlations of clinical events and provide better modeling capability when the training data is sparse. Experiments illustrate that our model is superior to the state-of-the-art methods on a real-world dataset MIMIC-III in all effectiveness measures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3007835","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9134772","Electronic medical records;medication recommendation;graph-attention neural networks;temporal updating","Medical diagnostic imaging;Correlation;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Neural networks;Logic gates;Task analysis","","30","","46","CCBY","7 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid development of deep learning, many applications of text generation using neural networks have emerged. Prescriptions are the doctors’ clinical experience and the results of neural networks also come from the accumulated experience. So, it is very feasible to apply deep learning techniques to the recommendation on TCM prescriptions. GAN and its variants have been applied in text generation recently. It has advantages in many aspects, such as the rapid speed of computation, the update of parameters by back propagation without Markov chain and more real data generation with two-players game. We attempted to know the important attributes of prescriptions and use these contents as the training data for variants of GAN to generate prescriptions. Specifically, we attempted to apply SeqGAN (Sequence Generative Adversarial Nets) and CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets) to prescription generations. By underlying the knowledge of TCM, the prescriptions with different characteristics can be successfully generated. In the experiments, we conducted the comparative evaluations on the original data with other models.

With the availability of large-scale genomic profiling via next-generation sequencing, it is now economically feasible to profile the whole transcriptome and genome of individual patients in order to identify their unique genetic mutations and differentially expressed genes, which are believed to be responsible for heterogeneous drug responses. Although subtyping analysis has identified patient subgroups sharing common biomarkers, there is no effective method to predict the drug response of individual patients precisely and reliably. Herein, we propose a novel computational algorithm to predict the drug response of individual patients based on personal genomic profiles, as well as pharmacogenomic and drug sensitivity data. Specifically, more than 600 cancer cell lines (viewed as individual patients) across over 50 types of cancers and their responses to 75 drugs were obtained from the genomics of drug sensitivity in cancer database. The drug-specific sensitivity signatures were determined from the changes in genomic profiles of individual cell lines in response to a specific drug. The optimal drugs for individual cell lines were predicted by integrating the votes from other cell lines. The experimental results show that the proposed drug prediction algorithm can be used to improve greatly the reliability of finding optimal drugs for individual patients and will, thus, form a key component in the precision medicine infrastructure for oncology care.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2412522","Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas(grant numbers:RP110532); NIH(grant numbers:U54 CA149196,RP140113); John S Dunn Research Foundation; Ting Tsung and Wei Fong Chao Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060697","personalized medicine;drug sensitivity;personal genomics;drug response prediction;Drug response prediction;drug sensitivity;personal genomics;personalized medicine","Drugs;Cancer;Genomics;Bioinformatics;Sensitivity;Gene expression;Prediction algorithms","Antineoplastic Agents;Cell Line, Tumor;Cluster Analysis;Gene Expression Profiling;Genomics;Humans;Medical Informatics Computing;Neoplasms;Pharmacogenetics;Precision Medicine","46","","32","OAPA","13 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current researches usually use transfer learning methods to apply the relevant technology of text generation to this task simply and roughly. Either they need to train a model with large number of standardized data set, or they ignore the domain knowledge and expertise of TCM. In order to solve these problems, we propose a hybrid neural network architecture for TCM prescription generation—PreGenerator. It includes a novel hierarchical retrieval mechanism, which can automatically extract prescription and herbal templates to facilitate accurate clinical prescription generation. Firstly, PreGenerator uses the Symptom-Prescription Retrieval (SHR) module to retrieve the most relevant prescriptions for a given patient’s symptoms. In order to follow the rule of compatibility of herbs, the Herb-Herb Retrieval (HHR) module is introduced to retrieve the next most relevant herb according to the conditioned generated herbs. Finally, the prescription decoder (PreD) fuses the symptom features, the retrieved prescription and herbal template features to generate the most relevant and effective Chinese medicine prescription. The validity of the model is verified by automatic evaluation and manual evaluation on the real medical case dataset. In addition, our model can recommend herbs that do not appear on the prescription label but are useful for relieving symptoms, which shows that our model can learn some interactions between herbs and symptoms.

To recommend compounds as new drug candidates, applying the computational approaches has a lower cost than conducting the wet-lab experiments. Machine learning-based methods, especially deep learning-based methods, have advantages in learning complex feature interactions between compounds and proteins. However, deep learning models will over-generalize and lead to the problem of predicting less relevant compound-protein pairs when the compound-protein feature interactions are high-dimensional sparse. This problem can be overcome by learning both low-order and high-order feature interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid model with Factorization Machines and Graph Neural Network called FMGNN to extract the low-order and high-order features, respectively. Then, we design a compound-protein interactions (CPIs) prediction method with pharmacophore features of compound and physicochemical properties of amino acids. The pharmacophore features can ensure that the prediction results much more fit the expectation of biological experiment and the physicochemical properties of amino acids are loaded into the embedding layer to improve the convergence speed and accuracy of protein feature learning. The experimental results on several datasets, especially on an imbalanced large-scale dataset, showed that our proposed method outperforms other existing methods for CPI prediction.
